    "original_body": "i hate to just call it the racing movie with chris hemsworth but i dont know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that dont know its based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed lauda was played by daniel bruhl you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds and i truly think without hyperbole that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career isnt as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaugheys performance in dallas buyers club matt did well dont get me wrong but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy but honestly its actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while hes banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think its interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other i think thats one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life doesnt normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made rush feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times whether or not theyre on the track but as far as the directing howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track theres a very raw scene in a hospital which i wont spoil but its hard to watch but i think the best part of the whole movie and what made it one of the best experiences ive ever had in a theater was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable and makes you feel like youre watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters i felt like i was actually on the race track im so so glad i was one of the apparently few people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters cant match but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to martys usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader i really cant recommend rush more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie ",

    "original_body": "edit i want to thank everyone who took the time to reply to me i was feeling very confused and lost when i posted the question and your advice really helped to clear things up i am hopeful that things will improve for both me and hersorry long post there is a tldr version at the endi am posting this because im depressed about a real possibility of losing a decadelong friendship the road to hell is indeed paved with good intentions i would appreciate any advice or comments i have a friend who is an abd phd candidate in humanities at a top school she is an international student and i share her mother tongue however i came to the us at a much younger agemy friends academic english is spotty and over the long course about a decade of our friendship ive sometimes helped her with editinggrad school applications important emails syllabi parts of papers and so forth i never complained because i had a lot of free time and it wasnt that difficulta year ago i asked for her help with a professional job i offered to pay the standard rate but she said she would rather have my editing service once again for her dissertation we agreed on a fixed amount of words i would edit and she completed her part of the agreement however that was the beginning of the problemattention to details was never her strong suit so she delivered a very substandard product i was expecting 85 of her work to be usable with me doing 15 as a finishing touch she ended up doing maybe 60 i only complained very gently because i was really in a bind and under a lot of stress i didnt want to cause dramashortly afterwards my friend ran into big trouble and drama galore with her dissertation and job search now she became super stressed and naturally i wanted to help her through such a difficult time aside from the chapters she had already written i also edited multiple job applications and email correspondenceshowever i gradually grew to resent the situation because1 she is still making what i regard as rudimentary mistakes in her writing after seven years of studying in prestigious graduate programs in englishspeaking countries 2 she gave me everything lastminute always expecting it within a day or two or even a few hours and it was always waaah help help i need to submit this by midnight or something like that i really hate job application statements so i did not relish not being able to do it at my own pace this is made a lot worse by my knowledge that she is a huge procrastinator ample evidence on social media i can understand procrastination as a way to cope with stress ive done it myself but it feels sounfair3 her dissertation itself im not familiar with her field but ive previously edited portions of her papers with no problem i honestly think this one is terrible i cant follow her logic so i dont know what shes trying to say which makes the editing process exponentially more painfulsoi finally snapped after one night she asked me to edit somethingonly to send it to the wrong email inbox i just sent you another document two days ago how in hell did you get my email wrong did you just not pay any attention at all she was incredulous that i would choose that moment to pick a fight with her because she was super stressed but i reallyjust had enough it wasnt that she was asking for my help it was the perceived thoughtlessness that made me angry we didnt talk for a week or two then we kind of just tried to move on from that incident she didnt dump job applications on me anymore but the problem of her dissertation remained i finally told her that yes i know i promised you i would help with the editing but i really feel like i got an unfair deal here after that i helped her with another chapter or two and yesterday she sent me her final chapter saying that i had already edited most of it and there was only about 2500 words left to edit that would be the last of her dissertationthe thing is she wanted it within two days and i had just agreed to do a professional job that would take up the rest of my week but i thought 2500 words well if i really tried i could squeeze it in so i said id take a look but after i started editing i realized it was at least 4000 words and im just not ready to wade through thative left her a message pointing out the discrepancy and said i cant do it due to prior commitments i have a sense of foreboding about what this might do to our friendship i fear that somewhere along the line ive placed her into a situation where she is dependent on me resents that dependence but has to be nice to mewhich just creates more resentmentim really sadtldr versioni promised longtime friend nonnative speaker that i would edit her dissertation for her like ive always helped her before she has been super stressed and making what i feel are unreasonable demands on my time with her dissertation and job application statements lots of frustration on both sides i feel like shes using not in the sense of manipulating me as a clutch and fear that our friendship might not recover",

    "original_body": " recently there was a rumor that drew mcweeny from hitfix reported apparently a source of his saw the film enjoyed it but noted that the film was receiving mixed reactions among others who saw it as a result warner bros is worried for batman v superman dawn of justice again keep in mind this is just a rumor drew has been wrong many times reporting that fantastic 4fan4stic received wonderful reactions at early testscreenings as well as numerous other blunders despite this report there have been other reports claiming that wb is indeed worried however the reason is that this film is apparently not a conventional superhero popcorn flick and worries that audiences wont appreciate it appropriately of course because sensationalism in journalism is so commonplace articles were published saying that dc thinks its fans are too dumb to understand batman v superman it seems like a couple days after the admittedly fantastic new trailer all this bad press and negativity started circulating around this film in my opinion if the film flops a large portion of the reason it does will be because it just got crushed by the immense amount of weight and expectation of course thats not to say the quality is in any way unrelated however i personally think thats highly unlikely there has been a recent figure claiming bvs may not turn a profit but the legitimacy of it is being questioned as many factors arent held into account for itpersonally im looking forward to bvs for the following reasonsnote i put a heavy focus on casting because this seems to be the most common issue people have with bvsben affleck as batman say what you will about ben affleck in my opinion the man has proven himself as a great actor when given the right material for him to shine some naysayers are so quick to point out early career blunders like gigli and daredevil but they dont seem to be acknowledging how great of an actor and director hes proven himself to be argo the town gone girl company men etc apart from that ben affleck looks exactly like bruce wayne this is coming from someone whos read a lot of batman and has been supporting this casting since day one ben affleck at the very least looks exactly like bruce wayne theres no guarantee that ben affleck will be a great batman but i think his previously shown acting abilities and appearance are more reason to have faith in this performance than to just simply point a finger at daredevil and expect it to be bad next jesse eisenberg as lex luthor i know a lot of people are not sold on this but i personally think this casting is going to prove to be pretty fruitful why because the cast never stops talking about how the character is jesse raves about the character being philosophically complex multifaceted etc im of course paraphrasing here additionally ben affleck henry cavill and zack snyder have all endorsed lex luthor without even being asked to a ridiculous extent im personally excited for eisenbergs performance as luthor and cant wait to see what hes going to dish out once again this performance might not turn out very good as well in my opinion based off of what ive seen i think jesse eisenberg is going to suit this role well theres the possibility that the cast is raving about it for damage control but in my opinion it seems a bit too genuine for that to be the case only time will tell im also looking forward to wonder woman thankfully a lot of the gal gadot hate has subsided which im happy about in my opinion this is another solid casting admittedly she isnt a giant slab of muscle but its important not to forget that comics always exaggerate features like muscle not even henry cavill looks exactly like superman that would be gross however shes built herself up mentally and physically for the role now suiting a far more athletic build granted i dont know how her performance will be since shes only delivered one very welldelivered line only time will tell but the inclusion of wonder woman alone is one of many factors that will guarantee at least a decent box office run for bvs finally the aspect for bvs that has me most excited is chris terrios screenplaychris terrio is the screenplay writer of argo won an oscar for it and director of the great show damages if you havent seen it i highly recommend it terrio was signed on to completely rewrite david goyers script and the film was pushed back a year in my opinion this is a good sign wb is signing on terrio who presumably came because of affleck to rewrite scripts and pushed back the film to get it just right im predicting a really tight screenplay like argo theres no reason to believe hell turn out a product anything less than great although terrio is lacking a substantiallength filmography talent exudes from everything hes worked on so far in both directorial and writing efforts finally im actually satisfied that zack snyder is directing this im a fan of the mans work visually but lets not mince words hes not regarded as the best storywriter however zack snyder has proved that when handed the right source material he can turn out a pretty good product in my opinion watchmen and 300 are both indicative of this hes had stinkers like sucker punch but hes at the very least a competent director who can work well with good scripts i think if the performances are good and the writingscreenplay is good we get the best of both worlds a movie with style and substancethere are other reasons im excited too i love this universe im happy that larry fong is in charge of the cinematography and i want to see how the superman character is expandedwhat do you guys think",

    "original_body": "lilo and stitch is probably the most feminist film disney has done its also  outside of that theory applied to it  one of the more under appreciated of the walt disney animation studios filmography what it manages to do was never done before it nor has it been done after it a film about family and about death  and about sisterhood told through the perspectives of two sisters and their alien pet there arent any princesses or princes nor any virtue of authority via means of gender roles there arent any love interests  and the one that could be considered is based refreshingly in the light of the woman being compatible with another person there isnt anything within the plot that has this be necessary nor to solidify that character as having a place in the world where shed need that or not better yet its set in contemporary timesthe two sisters nani and lilo lost their parents to a stormy car crash  hollywood cliche style but theres poignancy in this  as lilo herself now feels compelled to feed sandwiches to a fish in the pacific because as she argues or images it controls the weather and she wants to prevent anyone else from suffering the loss she has nani is her much older sister and shes stepped into the role of maternity with social services breathing down her back unfortunately with little to no experience in being motherly or having the kind of responsibility expected from her  and lilos own rebellious antics that cause conflict  nani is placed in a situation that no other disney character has before or since shes forced to be an adult and shes doing it out of the simple compassionate love for her sister of course the animated theatrics of the story involve an alien falling from outer space is posing as their family pet but that material is delightfully kitschy in a mesh of humor and science fiction while the drama  as deft as can be  is going on the humor itself doesnt distract from the soul it supplies in fact by the end of the film you kind of realize how intune it was with the drama in the first place the alien itself isnt necessarily a subtle archetype or symbol  because it quite bluntly represents the being of an outsider or external force that doesnt conform or fit in stitch the little blue alien is just that an alien but so is lilo the animation of lilo and stitch is simply sublime watercolors are all over the place giving a netrotoscope vibe of 70s disney but painting hawaii as a beautifully abstract gorgeous world its contrasted almost seamlessly by the twodimensional and defined characters and their immediate surroundings in this way the watercolors give a dimensional eye to the frames that recalls the softfocus of film itself but the excitement and beauty of it is in the simple fact that its animated to be such a way without the use of literal blur or fuzz when you set this colorful imagery next to the music elvis presley you have the films one and only pop culture reference  which is refreshingly absent in the dawning of an age in which dreamworks started wrecking havoc with such lazy references  theres a scene where the social worker sees lilo punishing her friends by placing voodoo replicas of them into a pickle jar he realizes shes odd but the greatest touch of her development as a character is that she herself doesnt  and that the movie never once asks her to change or gain the conformity of the other girls who only find her strange and bully her i can say a lot about lilo and stitch i could ramble on and on about certain scenes their wit and their heart  and their way of balancing both out  as a challenge  without seeming to break a sweat the affectionate bond between the two sisters is felt and the alien as symbol for all the drama is a way to introduce the playful animated aspects of it all without destroying all the material with misguided postshrek elements when family is broken it can be healed simply by realizing that it cannot be broken  not even with death thats a powerful truly real moral that isnt said often  and certainly not in such a witty entertaining and genuinely hilarious way ",

    "original_body": "hello everyone and welcome to the fifth installment of our  this project is an effort to demystify what the rules of the subreddit are to explain the reasoning behind why each rule came into being provide examples and explanation why a rule will be applicable in one case and not in another finally this project is here to get your feedback so that we can hear from the community what rules are working what ones arent and what ones are uncleartodays topic is addressing the rules concerning  also known as the 20 year rule so first the rule as stated it is quite brief and to the pointgtto discourage offtopic discussions of current events questions answers and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more inclusively eg 1996 and older while it might seem to be pretty straightforward im here to break it down and provide some explanation as to why this rule exists and why it is an important onewhy does history only start 20 years in the pastfirst things first we freely admit that the use of 20 years as a cutoff date is a mostly arbitrary one we very well could have gone with 15 years or we could have gone with 25 years im sure there is at least someone who wishes we had gone with a hard date of 1888 to prevent any hitler questions from being allowed on the sub by at least one definition yesterday could be construed as history or even what happened a few minutes ago but we firmly believe for reasons that will be laid out here that using the widest interpretation of what constitutes history is not only problematic for us from a moderation perspective but also a disservice to you the readers and your experience here in the end 20 years serves as a good balance for the various reasonings behind this rule which we will now get intothe reasoningspersonal experienceas already covered in a previous  we do not allow responses which are substantially based off of the personal experience of the poster in question as as we like to say you are not a source this can be complicated enough as it is since there are plenty of older redditors who remember the 50s or 60s and personally sorry one of the hardest moderation decisions i have had to make was removing a very nice very heartfelt response about growing up in northern ireland during the troubles but imagine if we take off the 20 year limit or substantially role it back to perhaps 5 years we already are dreading when 911 becomes fair game and that is still 5 years away im sure plenty of us will have moving stories of how we experienced that day to share but raskhistorians is not the place for it so basically what the 20 year cutoff does in this case is help discourage those responses  the cutoff date works nicely to keep out topics and events which would most likely solicit those personal responses or be otherwise based on recent connection to them this subreddit is not raskreddit and for people who want those personal responses even for topics which are gt20 years old we recommend that as a good subreddit to post in modern politicsthis is especially timely as the us presidential election goes into fullswing i think it goes without saying that politics can be contentious the legacy of politicians long out of office such as thatcher or adenauer not to mention dead for more than a century such as lincoln are still hotly debated and those alone can be tough topics to deal with fairly and objectively a roundtable on the soapboxing and political agenda rule will be forthcoming even though they are of course fair historical game but the obama administration the gwb years this takes the personal experience and personal opinions factor previously elucidated and throws in the clear possibility of quite acrimonious arguments and debate on topics which there might not really even be a clear answer if someone were to ask perhaps about the passage of obamacare in the absence of a 20 year rule we are of the firm belief that it simply couldnt be fairly moderated to the standards we expect here as it may take decades before we can even begin to analyze its passage and effects with remove for political questions which are likely to fall on the near side of 20 years we recommend users try raskpolitics of rneutralpoliticshistorical removethis brings us to the third prong on which the 20 year rule stands when talking about events that happened only in the past few years it is hard to have the proper perspective there are enough debates raging out there on the finer points of 12th century basket weaving technique or the rules for hideandseek in 1st century parthia and we have had a fair bit of time for matters to settle there absolute true objectivity may be a pipedream but the further back in time we go it is at least easier to agree on basic underlying facts even if interpretations might differ greatly at times you need to only look at news reporting on recent events to get a sense of just how problematic questions on perhaps the ongoing conflict in ukraine the arab spring or the invasion of iraq might be even discounting people throwing their opinions into the fray we can see this from past events such as world war ii where immediate reporting was often wildly offbase and in some cases it would take many decades for real solid understanding of certain events to materialize to borrow from urestricteddata who gtit is comparatively straightforward though there is always room for interpretation to talk about historical trends but the closer you get to the present the less we know about where things are going what really went on what really mattered we usually lack deep knowledge of sources as well and are reliant on journalistic accounts  the first draft of history that is not really history at all and in retrospect is often severely lacking in the whole storyin truth there are no doubt some events that with that metric we would prefer to limit even beyond the 20 year mark but as noted at the beginning it is a pragmatic choice which we feel offers the best balancethe grey zonenow even though you would think 20 years yesno is a pretty objective line to moderate there is always going to be that middlezone where maybe a question is ok and maybe it isnt so there are a few caveats that are worth mentioningcomparisons putting things into modern terms can often help contemporary audiences better understand a topic although it is a doubleedged sword with the specter of presentism sharpening the other blade and we get a fair number of questions that ask if  and likewise even if the question isnt phrased that way some answers will use an analogy of that sort to explain the rule of thumb to follow here is that while using a modern event or person as a frame of reference is generally fine the answer sought should be firmly historical questions where the phrasing invites or even requires discussion of that event to establish the baseline will be removed similarly with answers using something modern and uncontroversial please as an analogy wont result in removal but focusing on it as a real part of the answer likely will as in all cases if you have any doubts we welcome you to reach out to us and askto provide some examples who is more faithful to the doctrine of orthodox marxism bernie red sanders or stalin is going to get removed since it both relates to a highly contentious current issue as well as calls for considerable discussion to establish the baseline for comparison of the modern figure and of course if this wasnt a joke example it also violates the soapboxing rule and maybe polltype questions to boot another example and one which has been posted and removed a few times already how does the current syrian refugee crisis compare to the refugee situation postworld war ii would similarly come up against the 20 year rule since  it would not only require discussion of the crisis to a great degree but also may very well require debate to establish just how series the crisis is however a question which relates to something relatively uncontroversial and doesnt require any actual lt20 year discussion to deal with is often going to be allowed to slide for example something like were presidential nominations in the 19th century as hotly contested as the republican race is this year would be fine as the comparison regards a mostly uncontroversial fact and his asking about historical matters similarly a question such as  provides a forum for civil discourse on weighty matters rcredibledefense focuses on military affairs and conflicts generally additionally there are a number of subreddits which devote themselves to certain events such as rsyriancivilwar or rjihadinfocus hopefully users might be able to suggest some more worth noting",
