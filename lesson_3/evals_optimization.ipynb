      "During the Tang dynasty of China, which lasted from 618 to 907 AD, a remarkable era of cultural, political, and military development unfolded, marked by both periods of war and peace. The Tang dynasty, known for its flourishing arts and vibrant trade, experienced significant conflicts that shaped its history, yet also cherished long stretches of peace that contributed to its golden age.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial rise of the Tang dynasty was a time of war as the empire sought to unify China after the fall of the Sui dynasty. Through strategic military campaigns and skilled leadership, the Tang managed to assert control over extensive territories, but these conquests often led to ongoing war efforts. Despite the challenges of war, the Tang leadership emphasized the importance of peace within the empire, striving to maintain stability and prosperity. Peace was seen as essential for economic growth and cultural exchange, which flourished during these years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout its rule, the Tang engaged in war with neighboring nomadic tribes and other Chinese states. These wars, while often brutal, ultimately aimed to secure borders and restore peace along frontier regions. The Silk Road trade thrived not only because of the prosperity brought by peace but also because of the military might that kept potential enemies at bay. The periodic peace during the Tang era facilitated a vibrant cultural exchange, including the spread of Buddhism, poetry, and art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite enjoying long periods of peace, the Tang also faced internal and external wars that gradually weakened the dynasty. Rebellions and military conflicts, especially in its later years, disrupted peace and led to the eventual decline of the empire. These wars underscored the fragile balance between war and peace, with internal strife undermining the stability that had been built through years of diplomatic efforts aimed at maintaining peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the Tang dynasty was a time of war and peace, with war often serving as a means to achieve and sustain peace. Its history reflects a complex interplay where military conflict and efforts at peace coexisted, ultimately shaping one of China's most celebrated golden ages. The legacy of peace and war from this period continues to be studied and admired for its impact on Chinese civilization.\n",

      "When the Tang dynasty of China was in power, it was a period marked by both war and peace, shaping the empire’s history in significant ways. Initially, the Tang rulers sought to maintain peace within their vast territories by implementing strong administrative policies and encouraging cultural development. This emphasis on peace allowed the dynasty to flourish economically and culturally, making the Tang era one of the golden ages of Chinese civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite their focus on peace, the Tang dynasty could not avoid war. Several military campaigns were necessary to defend the empire's borders against nomadic tribes and rival states. The wars fought with the Tibetan Empire and the Turkic peoples were critical in asserting Tang dominance in Central Asia. Each war, although disruptive, eventually led to periods of peace through treaties and strategic alliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tang military also engaged in war to suppress rebellions and internal dissent. These wars, while tragic, reinforced the central authority and helped maintain peace within the empire. The famous An Lushan Rebellion was one such conflict that plunged the dynasty into prolonged war, causing widespread devastation. Following this war, the Tang rulers worked diligently to restore peace, stabilizing the empire through reforms and rebuilding efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade and diplomacy flourished during times of peace, enabling cultural exchanges along the Silk Road. This peace fostered advancements in art, literature, and technology, phenomena that defined the Tang dynasty. The coexistence of war and peace during this period demonstrates how the Tang dynasty managed to navigate the complexities of governance, balancing military strength with efforts to cultivate peace and prosperity throughout their reign.\n",

      "During the Tang dynasty of China (618–907 CE), the nation experienced both war and peace in significant measure. At the beginning of the Tang’s reign, there was war as the founders overthrew the Sui dynasty. However, after the initial war, Emperor Taizong and his successors pursued policies that strove for peace within the empire and with their neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tang dynasty frequently engaged in war on its borders, expanding Chinese territory through war against various nomadic tribes and neighboring states. However, after each successful war, the Tang rulers often tried to establish peace through diplomacy, tribute relationships, and strategic marriages. The court valued peace as a means to promote economic prosperity and cultural flourishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, war was never far away. Rebellions, such as the An Lushan Rebellion, erupted into violent war that disrupted years of relative peace. These episodes of war devastated many regions, but peace was eventually restored by the Tang government, though sometimes only temporarily. Despite intermittent war, the overall era was famed for its long periods of peace, enabling the arts and trade to thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "At times, the threat of war encouraged the Tang to strengthen their military and bureaucratic systems to maintain peace. Scholars and officials often debated how best to secure lasting peace, whether through deterrents of war or the cultivation of loyal subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, the Tang dynasty’s story was one of cycles between war and peace. War occasionally brought regional instability, but the dynasty’s enduring aim was to achieve peace both internally and externally. The greatest achievements of the Tang period, including advances in literature, art, and government, were made possible during stretches of peace that followed the hardships of war. Many historians view the Tang era as a golden age, in part because the leaders continuously worked – even after war – to secure and uphold the peace upon which prosperity depended.\n",

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world\\'s largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the [States](United)(United States). [family](His)(Walton family) has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\\n\\n## Early life\\n\\nSamuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in [Oklahoma](Kingfisher,)(Kingfisher, Oklahoma). He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother\\'s Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for [Life](Metropolitan)(Metropolitan Life) Insurance, where he [foreclosed](foreclosure) on farms during the [Depression](Great)(Great Depression).\\n\\nHe and his family (now with another son, [James](James \"Bud\" Walton), born in 1921) moved from [Oklahoma](Oklahoma). They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in [Missouri](Shelbina,)(Shelbina, Missouri), Sam became the youngest [Scout](Eagle)(Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)) in the state\\'s history. In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the [Eagle Scout Award](Distinguished)(Distinguished Eagle Scout Award) from the [Scouts of America](Boy)(Boy Scouts of America).\\n\\nEventually the family moved to [Missouri](Columbia,)(Columbia, Missouri). Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver *[Daily Tribune](Columbia)(Columbia Daily Tribune)* newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions. Upon graduating from [H. Hickman High School](David)(David H. Hickman High School) in Columbia, he was voted \"Most Versatile Boy\".\\n\\n[[in his high school yearbook, 1936](File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|Walton)]\\n\\nAfter high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the [of Missouri](University)(University of Missouri) as an [ROTC](ROTC) cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the [Phi](Zeta)(Zeta Phi) chapter of [Theta Pi](Beta)(Beta Theta Pi) fraternity. He was also tapped by [QEBH](QEBH), the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society [and Blade](Scabbard)(Scabbard and Blade). Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and [College](Stephens)(Stephens College). Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor\\'s degree in economics, he was voted \"permanent president\" of the class.\\n\\nFurthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.\\n\\nWalton joined [C. Penney](J.)(J. C. Penney) as a management trainee in [Moines, Iowa](Des)(Des Moines, Iowa), three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in [War II](World)(World War II). In the meantime, he worked at a [DuPont](DuPont) munitions plant near [Oklahoma](Tulsa,)(Tulsa, Oklahoma). Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the [Army Intelligence Corps](U.S.)(Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)), supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at [Douglas](Fort)(Fort Douglas, Utah) in [Lake City](Salt)(Salt Lake City), [Utah](Utah). He eventually reached the rank of [captain](Captain (United States O-3)).\\n\\n## The first stores\\n\\nIn 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a [Franklin](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)) variety store in [Arkansas](Newport,)(Newport, Arkansas). The store was a franchise of the [Brothers](Butler)(Butler Brothers) chain.\\n\\nWalton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny \"Eagle\" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.\\n\\nWith the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.\\n\\nAdmiring Sam\\'s great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store\\'s inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called \"a fair price\".Walton & Huey, *Made in America: My Story*, p. 30.\\n\\n[[Five and Dime store, Bentonville, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|left|Walton\\'s Five and Dime, now the Walmart Historical Museum, Bentonville.](File:Walton\\'s)]\\n\\nWith a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of [Arkansas](Bentonville,)(Bentonville, Arkansas). Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam\\'s knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen\\'s father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.\\n\\nBefore he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.\\n\\n## A chain of Ben Franklin stores\\n\\nWith the new Bentonville \"Five and Dime\" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.\\n\\nAfter succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the [baby boom](postwar)(Post–World War II baby boom) in full effect), Walton became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more [Franklin franchises](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)). (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother [\"Bud\" Walton](James)(James \"Bud\" Walton) having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son [John](John T. Walton) would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)\\n\\nIn 1954, he opened a store with his brother [Bud](James \"Bud\" Walton) in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of [City, Missouri](Kansas)(Kansas City, Missouri). With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklin\\'s and one independent, in Fayetteville).\\n\\nSam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.\\n\\n## First Walmart\\n\\nThe first true [Walmart](Walmart) opened on July 2, 1962, in [Arkansas](Rogers,)(Rogers, Arkansas). Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.\\n\\nAs the [Meijer](Meijer) store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer\\'s original innovative concept.\\n\\nContrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton\\'s model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.\\n\\nTo make his model work, he emphasized [logistics](logistics), particularly locating stores within a day\\'s drive of Walmart\\'s regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growthfrom 1977\\'s 190 stores to 1985\\'s 800was achieved.\\n\\nGiven its scale and economic influence, Walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store. These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the \"Walmart Effect\".\\n\\n## Personal life\\n\\nWalton married [Robson](Helen)(Helen Walton) on Valentine\\'s Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: [Robson (Rob)](Samuel)(Samuel Robson Walton) born in 1944, [Thomas](John)(John Thomas Walton) (1946–2005), [Carr (Jim)](James)(James Carr Walton) born in 1948, and [Louise](Alice)(Alice Louise Walton) born in 1949.\\n\\nWalton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students. The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of “service leadership” into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of [Christ](Jesus) being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in [Christianity](Christianity).\\n\\nWalton was diagnosed and treated for [cell leukemia](Hairy)(Hairy cell leukemia).\\n\\n### Death\\n\\nWalton  died on Sunday, April 5, 1992 (three months shy of Walmart\\'s thirtieth anniversary), of [myeloma](multiple)(multiple myeloma), a type of blood cancer, in [Rock, Arkansas](Little)(Little Rock, Arkansas). The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Walmart stores. At the time, his company employed 400,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50&nbsp;billion flowed from 1,735 Walmarts, 212 Sam\\'s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.\\n\\nHis remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: [Walton](Rob)(S. Robson Walton) succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and [Walton](John)(John T. Walton) was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son [Walton](Jim)(Jim Walton) is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam\\'s brother [Walton](Bud)(Bud Walton)&mdash;[Kroenke](Ann)(Ann Walton Kroenke) and [Laurie](Nancy)(Nancy Walton Laurie)&mdash;hold smaller shares in the company.\\n\\n## Legacy\\n\\n[[File:President George H.

       "  'answer': 'Sam Walton was an American business magnate best known as the founder of Walmart and Sam’s Club, two retail giants that revolutionized the American and global retail landscape. Born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma in 1918, Walton experienced a modest upbringing during the Great Depression, which instilled in him a strong work ethic and entrepreneurial drive from a young age. After graduating from the University of Missouri and serving as an Army captain in World War II, Walton entered the retail business, initially operating Ben Franklin variety stores before opening his first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. He distinguished himself through innovative strategies such as locating stores in small towns, focusing on logistics and supply chain efficiency, and encouraging a culture of employee ownership.\\n\\nUnder Walton’s leadership, Walmart grew rapidly, becoming the world’s largest corporation by revenue and the biggest private employer globally. Walton’s approach to business emphasized low prices, American-made products, and efficient distribution, which allowed Walmart to undercut competitors and dominate the markets it entered—a phenomenon known as the \"Walmart Effect.\" He also pioneered management techniques like investing store managers in their outlets and frequently visiting stores to share best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and customer focus. By the time of his death in 1992, Walmart operated thousands of stores, employed hundreds of thousands of people, and had annual sales approaching $50 billion.\\n\\nIn his personal life, Walton was devoted to his family, faith, and philanthropy, serving as an elder and Sunday school teacher in his church and incorporating the concept of servant leadership into Walmart’s corporate culture. He was honored with numerous accolades, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was consistently ranked among the wealthiest Americans, with the Walton family remaining the richest in the United States for years. Sam Walton’s legacy endures through the continued success of Walmart, its philanthropic initiatives, and institutions bearing his name, such as the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas.',\n",

[\"A Defense of the Charlottesville Counter‐Protesters\"](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5efa3e4eb1788c3251bc5750/t/5f1e836db4238228f9f11697/1595835245782/charlottesville.pdf) . *Anthropology News*. **58** (5): 94–99.\\n\\nThere have been numerous efforts to discredit antifa by various right-wing groups and individuals. Some have been done via hoaxes on social media, many of them [flag](false)(false flag) operations originating from [alt-right](alt-right) and [4chan](4chan) users posing as antifa backers on [Twitter](Twitter); some hoaxes have been picked up and portrayed as fact by right-leaning media and politicians. There were repeated calls by Donald Trump and [Barr](William)(William Barr) to designate antifa as a terrorist organization despite the fact that it is not an organization. Academics, legal experts, and others have argued such an action would exceed the authority of the presidency and violate the [Amendment](First)(First Amendment). Several analyses, reports, and studies have concluded that antifa is not a major domestic terrorism risk.\\n\\n## Definition\\n\\nThe English word *antifa* is a [loanword](loanword) from the German *Antifa*, where it is a shortened form of the word *antifaschistisch* (\"anti-fascist\") and a nickname of *[Aktion](Antifaschistische)(Antifaschistische Aktion)* (1932–1933), a short-lived group which inspired the wider [movement in Germany](antifa)(antifa movement in Germany). The German word *Antifa* itself first appeared in 1930 and the long form *antifaschistisch* was borrowed from the original Italian *anti-Fascisti* (\"anti-fascists\"). [Dictionaries](Oxford)(Oxford Dictionaries (website)) placed *antifa* on its shortlist for [of the year](word)(word of the year) in 2017 and stated the word \"emerged from relative obscurity to become an established part of the English lexicon over the course of 2017.\"\\n\\nThe pronunciation of the word in English is not settled as it may be stressed on either the first or the second syllable.\\n\\nAccording to the [League](Anti-Defamation)(Anti-Defamation League) (ADL) the term *antifa* \"is often misapplied to include all [counter-protesters](counter-protesters)\".\\n\\nDuring the [administration](Trump)(Trump administration), the term *antifa* became \"a conservative catch-all\" term as [Trump](Donald)(Donald Trump), administration officials, Trump [supporters](base)(Base (politics)), and [right-wing](right-wing) commentators applied the label to all sorts of [left-leaning](Centre-left politics) or [liberal](Modern liberalism in the United States) protest actions. [Conservative](Conservativism in the United States) writers such as [Brent Bozell III](L.)(L. Brent Bozell III) labeled Black Lives Matter as \"antifa\". *[Politico](Politico)* reported that \"the term [*antifa*] is a potent one for conservatives\" because \"[i]t\\'s the violent distillation of everything they fear could come to pass in an all-out culture war. And it\\'s a quick way to brand part of the opposition.\" [Reid Ross](Alexander)(Alexander Reid Ross), who teaches at [State University](Portland)(Portland State University), argues that the popularization of the term *antifa* was a reaction to the popularization of the term *[alt-right](alt-right)*, \"to the point where [*antifa*] simply describes people who are anti-fascist or people who are against racism and are willing to protest against it.\"\\n\\n## Movement structure and ideology\\n\\n[[rally protest DSC 4402 (36703241166).jpg|thumb|250px|Anti-fascists with banner reading \"good night white pride\"](File:Trump)]\\n\\nAntifa is not a unified organization but rather a movement without a hierarchical leadership structure, comprising multiple autonomous groups and individuals. The movement is loosely affiliated and has no chain of command, with antifa groups instead sharing \"resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity.\" According to Mark Bray, \"members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right\" and \"concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small.\" Bray adds that \"[i]t\\'s important to understand that antifa politics, and antifa\\'s methods, are designed to stop white supremacists, fascists, and neo-Nazis as easily as possible.\" For Bray, \"[t]he vast majority of their activities are nonviolent. They function in some ways like private investigators; they track neo-Nazi organizing across multiple social-media platforms.\" In regard to [doxing](doxing), Bray says that it is about \"telling people that they have a Nazi living down the street, or telling employers that they\\'re employing white supremacists\", adding that \"after Charlottesville, a lot of the repercussions that these khaki-wearing, tiki-torch white supremacists faced were their employers firing them and their families repudiating what they do.\"\\n\\nActivists typically organize protests via social media and through websites. Some activists have built peer-to-peer networks, or use encrypted-texting services like [Signal](Signal (software)). Chauncey Devega of *[Salon](Salon (website))* described antifa as an organizing strategy, not a group of people. According to a member of a New York City antifa group, their group\\'s identification research on whether an individual or group is \"fascist, Alt Right, White Nationalist, etc.\" is \"based on which groups they are a part of and endorse.\" While noting that \"Nazis, fascists, white nationalists, anti-Semites and Islamophobes\" are specific overlapping categories, the main focus is \"on groups and individuals which endorse, or work directly in alliance with, white supremacists and white separatists. We try to be very clear and precise with how we use these terms.\" According to Colin Clarke and Michael Kenney, [actions](direct)(direct actions) such as [protests](anti-Trump)(anti-Trump protests), demonstrations against the [alt-right](alt-right) provocateur [Yiannopoulos](Milo)(Milo Yiannopoulos) and the clash with [neo-Nazis](neo-Nazis) and [supremacists](white)(white supremacists) at the [the Right rally](Unite)(Unite the Right rally) \"reflects many Antifa supporters\\' belief that Trump is a fascist demagogue who threatens the existence of America\\'s pluralistic, multi-racial democracy. This factor helps explain why such Antifa supporters are so quick to label the president\\'s \\'Make America Great Again\\' supporters as fascists — and why Trump is so quick to label Antifa as a terrorist organization.\"\\n\\nThe antifa movement grew after the [United States presidential election](2016)(2016 United States presidential election). As of August 2017, approximately 200 groups existed, of varying sizes and levels of activity. It is particularly active in the [Northwest](Pacific)(Pacific Northwest), such as in [Oregon](Portland,)(Portland, Oregon).\\n\\nIndividuals involved in the antifa movement tend to hold [anti-authoritarian](anti-authoritarian), [anti-capitalist](anti-capitalist), [anti-fascist](anti-fascist), and [anti-state](anti-state) views, subscribing to a varied range of [left-wing](left-wing) ideologies. A majority of adherents are [anarchists](anarchists), [communists](communists), and other [socialists](socialists) who describe themselves as [revolutionaries](revolutionaries), although some [democrats](social)(social democrats) and others on the [Left](American)(American Left), among them [environmentalists](environmentalists), [LGBT](LGBT social movements) and [rights](indigenous)(indigenous rights) advocates, also adhere to the antifa movement. According to professor of journalism and political science at the [Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York](Craig)(Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York), [Beinart](Peter)(Peter Beinart), \"antifa is heavily composed of anarchists\" and \"its activists place little faith in the state, which they consider complicit in fascism and racism.\" Antifa activists\\' ideologies, as well as their involvement in violent actions against far-right opponents and the police has led some scholars and news media to characterize the movement as [far-left](far-left)Academic sources:\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nNews sources:\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n* and [militant](militant).Academic sources:\\n\\n*\\n\\nNews sources:\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nIn his article \"The Rise of the Violent Left\" for *[Atlantic](The)(The Atlantic)*, Beinart writes that antifa activists \"prefer direct action: They pressure venues to deny white supremacists space to meet. They pressure employers to fire them and landlords to evict them. And when people they deem racists and fascists manage to assemble, antifa\\'s partisans try to break up their gatherings, including by force.\" According to historian [Bray](Mark)(Mark Bray (historian)), an expert on the movement, the \"vast majority of anti-fascist organizing is nonviolent. But their willingness to physically defend themselves and others from white supremacist violence and preemptively shut down fascist organizing efforts before they turn deadly distinguishes them from liberal anti-racists.\"\\n\\nDescribed as a pan-leftist and non-hierarchical movement, antifa is united by opposition to [extremism](right-wing)(right-wing extremism) and [supremacy](white)(white supremacy). Antifa activists reject both [conservative](Conservatism in the United States) and [liberal](Modern liberalism in the United States) anti-fascism. The antifa movement generally eschews mainstream [democracy](liberal)(liberal democracy), having \"an illiberal disdain for the confines of mainstream politics\", and favoring [action](direct)(direct action) over [politics](electoral)(electoral politics). Bray states that \"[t]he vast majority of antifa militants are radical anti-capitalists who oppose the Democratic Party\" and that [Party](Democratic)(Democratic Party (United States)) leaders, including [Pelosi](Nancy)(Nancy Pelosi) and [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden), have condemned antifa and political violence more broadly. Despite antifa\\'s opposition to the Democratic Party and liberalism, some [right-wing](right-wing) commentators have accused their adherents of being aided by \"liberal sympathizers\" and \"affiliated with the Democratic Party\" as well as being \"a single organization\", \"funded by liberal financiers like [Soros](George)(George Soros)\", \"mastermind[ing] violence at Black Lives Matter protests\", and that \"Antifascists are the \\'real fascists\\'\", with Bray citing these as examples of five myths about antifa.\\n\\nThe ADL states that \"[m]ost antifa come from the anarchist movement or from the far left, though since the 2016 presidential election, some people with more mainstream political backgrounds have also joined their ranks.\" Similarly, Bray argues that \"[i]t\\'s also important to remember that these are self-described revolutionaries. They\\'re anarchists and communists who are way outside the traditional conservative-liberal spectrum.\" [News](ABC)(ABC News) notes that \"[w]hile antifa\\'s political leanings are often described as \\'far-left,\\' experts say members\\' radical views vary and can intersect with communism, socialism and anarchism.\" According to [CNN](CNN), \"Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left -- often the far left -- but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform.\" The [BBC](BBC) notes that, \"as their name indicates, Antifa focuses more on fighting far-right ideology than encouraging pro-left policy.\" Beinart argues that the [of Donald Trump](election)(election of Donald Trump) vitalized the antifa movement and some on the mainstream left were more willing to support them as a tactical opposition.\\n\\n## History\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nWhen Italian dictator [Mussolini](Benito)(Benito Mussolini) consolidated power under his [Fascist Party](National)(National Fascist Party) in the mid-1920s, an oppositional [anti-fascist](anti-fascist) movement surfaced both in Italy and countries such as the United States. Many anti-fascist leaders in the United States were anarchist, socialist, and [syndicalist](syndicalist) émigrés from Italy with experience in labor organizing and militancy. Ideologically, antifa in the United States sees itself as the successor to anti-Nazi activists of the 1930s. European activist groups that originally organized to oppose [War II](World)(World War II)-era fascist dictatorships re-emerged in the 1970s and 1980s to oppose [supremacy](white)(white supremacy) and [skinhead](skinhead)s, eventually spreading to the United States.\\n\\nModern antifa politics can be traced to opposition to the infiltration of Britain\\'s [punk](Punk rock) scene by [power skinheads](white)(white power skinheads) in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of [neo-Nazism](neo-Nazism) in Germany following the [of the Berlin Wall](fall)(fall of the Berlin Wall). In Germany, young leftists, including anarchists and punk fans, renewed the practice of street-level anti-fascism. [Beinart](Peter)(Peter Beinart) writes that \"[i]n the late \\'80s, left-wing punk fans in the United States began following suit, though they initially called their groups Anti-Racist Action, on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than they would be with fighting fascism.\"\\n\\n[College](Dartmouth)(Dartmouth College) historian Mark Bray, author of *[The Anti-Fascist Handbook](Antifa:)(Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook)*, credits [Action](Anti-Racist)(Anti-Racist Action) (ARA) as the precursor of modern antifa groups in the United States. In the late 1980s and 1990s, ARA activists toured with popular punk rock and skinhead bands in order to prevent [Klansmen](Klansmen), neo-Nazis and other assorted white supremacists from recruiting. Their motto was \"We go where they go\", by which they meant that they would confront [far-right](far-right) activists in concerts and actively remove their materials from public places. In 2002, ARA disrupted a speech in Pennsylvania by [F. Hale](Matthew)(Matthew F. Hale), the head of the white supremacist group [Church of the Creator](World)(World Church of the Creator), resulting in a fight and 25 arrests.\\n\\nIn 2007, [City Antifa](Rose)(Rose City Antifa), likely the first group to utilize the name antifa, was formed in [Oregon](Portland,)(Portland, Oregon) by former ARA members. Other antifa groups in the United States have other genealogies. In [Minnesota](Minneapolis,)(Minneapolis, Minnesota), a group called the Baldies was formed in 1987 with the intent to fight neo-Nazi groups directly. In 2013, the \"most radical\" chapters of ARA formed the [Antifa Network](Torch)(Torch Antifa Network), which has chapters throughout the United States. Other antifa groups are a part of different associations such as NYC Antifa or operate independently.\\n\\n### Activities\\n\\nAccording to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the [State University, San Bernardino](California)(California State University, San Bernardino), antifa activists feel the need to participate in violent actions because \"they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.\" Historian Mark Bray wrote that the adherents \"reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy. Instead they advocate popular opposition to fascism as we witnessed in Charlottesville.\" The idea of [action](direct)(direct action) is central to the antifa movement. Former antifa organizer [Crow](Scott)(Scott Crow (activist)) told an interviewer:\\n\\nA manual posted on \\'\\'[Going Down](It\\'s)(It\\'s Going Down (collective))*, an anarchist website, warns against accepting \"people who just want to fight\". Furthermore, the website notes that \"physically confronting and defending against fascists is a necessary part of anti-fascist work, but is not the only or even necessarily the most important part.\"\\n\\n[[File:Patriot Prayer vs Antifa protests.

According to the *[Angeles Times](Los)(Los Angeles Times)*, antifa protesters have engaged in \"mob violence, attacking a small showing of supporters of President Trump and others they accused, sometimes inaccurately, of being white supremacists or Nazis.\" Antifa activists also used clubs and dyed liquids against white supremacists in Charlottesville. Media have reported on specific instances of antifa protesters harassing or attacking journalists or causing damage to their equipment, while they were documenting protests — namely reporters of *[Washington Post](The)(The Washington Post)*, a contributor to [VICE](Vice (magazine)) and [Reuters](Reuters), and others. According to *[Kansas City Star](The)(The Kansas City Star)*, police asked persons carrying firearms (including both antifa members and members of the far-right [movement](militia)(militia movement) group [Percenters](Three)(Three Percenters)) at a September 2017 rally in Kansas City to remove ammunition from their weapons.\\n\\nApart from the other activities, antifa activists engage in [aid](mutual)(Mutual aid (organization theory)) such as disaster response in the case of [Harvey](Hurricane)(Hurricane Harvey). According to Natasha Lennard in *[Nation](The)(The Nation)*, antifa groups as of January 2017 were working with [interfaith](Interfaith dialogue) groups and churches \"to create a New [Movement](Sanctuary)(Sanctuary Movement), continuing and expanding a 40-year-old practice of providing spaces for refugees and immigrants.\"\\n\\nAntifa activists often use the [bloc](black)(black bloc) tactic in which people dress in black and cover their faces in order to thwart surveillance and create a sense of equality and solidarity among participants. Antifa activists wear masks to hide their \"identity from protestors on the other side (who might [dox](Doxing) people they disagree with) or from police and cameras\" and for philosophical reasons such as the beliefs that \"hierarchies are bad and that remaining anonymous helps keep one\\'s ego in check.\" Joseph Bernstein from *[News](BuzzFeed)(BuzzFeed News)* says that antifa activists also wear masks because \"they fear retribution from the far right and the cops, whom they believe are sympathetic if not outright supportive to fascists.\"\\n\\nWhen antifa became prominent in the news during the [Floyd protests](George)(George Floyd protests) and was under attack for being responsible for much, if not most of the violence, a report in *[Vox](Vox (website))* stated that \"[m]embers of antifa groups do more conventional activism, flyer campaigns, and community organizing, on behalf of anti-racist and anti-white nationalist causes\", quoting Mark Bray as saying that this was the \"vast majority\" of what they did. In July 2020, *[Guardian](The)(The Guardian)* reported that \"a California-based organizer and anti-fascist activist\" stated she saw \"Trump\\'s claims about antifa violence, particularly during the George Floyd protests, as a message to his \\'hardcore\\' supporters that it was appropriate to attack people who came out to protest.\" In August 2020, many small business owners interviewed by *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)* in what was the [Hill Autonomous Zone](Capitol)(Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone) in Seattle blamed people they identified as antifa for much of the violence and intimidation of their patrons while distinguishing antifa from Black Lives Matter.\\n\\n### Notable actions\\n\\nAlong with [bloc](black)(black bloc) activists, antifa groups were among those who protested the 2016 election of [Trump](Donald)(Donald Trump). Antifa activists also participated in the [2017 Berkeley protests](February)(February 2017 Berkeley protests) against [alt-right](alt-right) provocateur speaker [Yiannopoulos](Milo)(Milo Yiannopoulos), where antifa gained mainstream attention, with media reporting antifa protesters \"throwing Molotov cocktails and smashing windows\" and causing $100,000 worth of damage.\\n\\nIn August 2017, antifa counter-protesters at the [the Right rally](Unite)(Unite the Right rally) in [Virginia](Charlottesville,)(Charlottesville, Virginia), reported *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)*, \"used clubs and dyed liquids against the white supremacists.\" Groups preparing to protest the [Free Speech Rally](Boston)(Boston Free Speech Rally) saw their plans become viral following the violence in Charlottesville. The event drew a largely peaceful crowd of 40,000 counter-protesters. In *[Atlantic](The)(The Atlantic)*, [Coppins](McKay)(McKay Coppins) stated that the 33 people arrested for violent incidents were \"mostly egged on by the minority of \\'Antifa\\' agitators in the crowd.\"\\n\\nPresident Trump described the protesters outside his August 2017 rally in [Arizona](Phoenix,)(Phoenix, Arizona) as \"antifa\".\\n\\n[[8 27 17-7123 (36887356645).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Antifa rally at Berkeley protests on August 27, 2017](File:Berkeley)]\\n\\nDuring the [protests on August 27, 2017](Berkeley)(Berkeley protests on August 27, 2017), an estimated one hundred antifa and anarchist protesters joined a crowd of 2,000–4,000 other protesters to confront alt-right demonstrators and Trump supporters who showed up for a \"Say No to Marxism\" rally that had been cancelled by organizers due to security concerns. Following the incident, [Arreguin](Jesse)(Jesse Arreguin), the mayor of Berkeley, suggested classifying the city\\'s antifa as a gang.[[anti deporation protest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Protesters hold an antifa banner in Minneapolis on February 18, 2017](File:Anarchist)]\\n\\nIn November 2018, police investigated a left-wing group associated with antifa, Smash Racism D.C., following a protest by 12-20 people outside the home of *[Daily Caller](The)(The Daily Caller)* founder [Carlson](Tucker)(Tucker Carlson), who they accused of being a racist and white supremacist. Activists of the group defaced the driveway of Carlson\\'s property by spray-painting an [symbol](anarchist)(anarchist symbol) on it.\\n\\n## Public reactions\\n\\n### Academics, scholars and activists\\n\\nHistorian [Bray](Mark)(Mark Bray (historian)), who has studied the antifa movement, stated that \"[g]iven the historical and current threat that white supremacist and fascist groups pose, it\\'s clear to me that organized, collective self-defense is not only a legitimate response, but lamentably an all-too-necessary response to this threat on too many occasions.\" Alexander Reid Ross, a lecturer in geography and an author on the contemporary right, has argued that antifa groups represented \"one of the best models for channeling the popular reflexes and spontaneous movements towards confronting fascism in organized and focused ways.\"\\n\\nHistorian and *[Dissent](Dissent (American magazine))* magazine editor [Kazin](Michael)(Michael Kazin) wrote that \"[n]on-leftists often see the left as a disruptive, lawless force. Violence tends to confirm that view.\" Historian [Ben-Ghiat](Ruth)(Ruth Ben-Ghiat) was \"worried that antifa\\'s methods could feed into what she said were false equivalencies that seek to lump violence on the left with attacks by the right.\" Ben-Ghiat argued that \"[[Milkshaking|[t]hrowing a milkshake]] is not equivalent to killing someone, but because the people in power are allied with the right, any provocation, any dissent against right-wing violence, backfires\", with the effect that \"[m]ilitancy on the left\" can \"become a justification for those in power and allies on the right to crack down\" on the left.\\n\\n[Beinart](Peter)(Peter Beinart), a professor of journalism and political science, wrote that \"[a]ntifa believes it is pursuing the opposite of authoritarianism. Many of its activists oppose the very notion of a centralized state. But in the name of protecting the vulnerable, antifascists have granted themselves the authority to decide which Americans may publicly assemble and which may not. That authority rests on no democratic foundation. [...] The people preventing Republicans from safely assembling on the streets of Portland may consider themselves fierce opponents of the authoritarianism growing on the American right. In truth, however, they are its unlikeliest allies.\"\\n\\nAnti-racist public intellectual [West](Cornel)(Cornel West), who attended a counter-protest to the [the Right rally](Unite)(Unite the Right rally), said in an interview that \"we would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists\", describing a situation where a group of 20 counter-protesters were surrounded by marchers whom he described as \"neofascists\".\\n\\nVeteran radical activist [Chomsky](Noam)(Noam Chomsky) described antifa as \"a major gift to the right\", arguing that \"the movement was self-destructive and constituted a tiny faction on the periphery of the left.\" Eleanor Penny, an author on fascism and the far-right, argued against Chomsky that \"physical resistance has time and again protected local populations from racist violence, and prevented a gathering caucus of fascists from making further inroads into mainstream politics\". Natasha Lennard has argued against Chomsky and others, citing [B. Spencer](Richard)(Richard B. Spencer)\\'s suspension of his college tour in March 2018, as \"a sharp rebuttal to the glut of claims that antifa practices serve as a gift to the far right.\"\\n\\nSome \"anti-anti-fascists\" on the left have argued that antifa attack a symptom of [democracy](liberal)(liberal democracy) rather than combating [racism](structural)(structural racism) itself and in doing so distance themselves from [politics](revolutionary)(revolutionary politics).\\n\\n### Civil rights organizations\\n\\nIn 2020, the ADL said that while there have been hundreds of murders by far-right groups in the last few decades, there has only been [suspected antifa-related murder](one)(Killings of Aaron Danielson and Michael Reinoehl).\\n\\nAccording to the [Poverty Law Center](Southern)(Southern Poverty Law Center) (SPLC), designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization is dangerous and a threat to civil liberties. The SPLC also reported that antifa members \"have been involved in skirmishes and property crimes, \\'but the threat of lethal violence pales in comparison to that posed by far-right extremists.\\'\"\\n\\n### Law enforcement and officials\\n\\nIn June 2017, the antifa movement was linked to \"anarchist extremism\" by the [Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness](New)(New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness). This assessment was replaced with one in 2019 which states that \"Antifa is a movement that focuses on issues involving racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism, as well as other perceived injustices. The majority of Antifa members do not promote or endorse violence; however, the movement consists of anarchist extremists and other individuals who seek to carry out acts of violence in order to forward their respective agendas.\" In September 2017, *[Politico](Politico)* obtained confidential documents and interviews indicating that the [of Homeland Security](Department)(Department of Homeland Security) (DHS) and the [Bureau of Investigation](Federal)(Federal Bureau of Investigation) (FBI) believed that \"anarchist extremists\" were the primary instigators of violence at public rallies against a range of targets in April 2016.\\n\\nIn July 2020, [Director](FBI)(FBI Director) [A. Wray](Christopher)(Christopher A. Wray), who had  stated in a press release on June 4 that \"anarchists like Antifa\" are \"exploiting this situation to pursue violent, extremist agendas\", testified to the [Judiciary Committee](Senate)(Senate Judiciary Committee) that the agency \"considers antifa more of an ideology than an organization\" which was later reiterated the same year in a September 17 remark to lawmakers. This contradicted President Trump\\'s remarks about antifa and put Wray at odds with the Trump administration. According to the [Press](Associated)(Associated Press), Wray \"did not dispute that antifa activists were a serious concern\", stating that antifa was a \"real thing\" and that the FBI had undertaken \"any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists\", including into individuals who identify with antifa, whom the FBI identified as \"a movement or an ideology\" rather than as \"a group or an organization\". Wray stated that \"racially motivated violent extremists, such as white supremacists, have been responsible for the most lethal attacks in the U.S. in recent years\", although \"this year the most lethal violence has come from anti-government activists, such as anarchists and militia-types.\"\\n\\nThree August 2020 DHS draft reports did not mention antifa as a domestic terrorism risk and ranked white supremacy as the top risk, higher than that of foreign terrorist groups.\\n\\n### Members of Congress\\n\\nOn August 29, 2017, [Pelosi](Nancy)(Nancy Pelosi), then [Minority Leader](House)(House Minority Leader) for the [Party](Democratic)(Democratic Party (United States)), condemned the violence of antifa activists in Berkeley.\\n\\nIn July 2019, [Republican](Republican Party (United States)) Senators [Cassidy](Bill)(Bill Cassidy) and [Cruz](Ted)(Ted Cruz) introduced a [resolution](nonbinding)(nonbinding resolution) that would designate antifa a domestic terrorist organization.\\n\\nIn June 2020, Republican Senator [Cotton](Tom)(Tom Cotton) advocated using military force to quell nationwide [against police brutality and racism](protests)(George Floyd protests), calling for the [Airborne Division](101st)(101st Airborne Division) to be deployed to combat what he called \"Antifa terrorists\". Cruz accused \"Antifa protesters\" of \"organizing these acts of terror\" and called for \"systematic law enforcement targeting Antifa and other terrorist groups\".\\n\\nIn September 2020, [Party presidential candidate](Democratic)(2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate) [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden) also condemned antifa violent actions, having already condemned violence across the political spectrum and expressed his support for peaceful protests.\\n\\n### Trump administration\\n\\nIn August 2017, a petition was lodged with the White House petitioning system [the People](We)(We the People (petitioning system)) calling upon President [Trump](Donald)(Donald Trump) to formally classify \"AntiFa\" as terrorist. The White House responded in 2018 that federal law does not have a mechanism for formally designating domestic terrorist organizations. The writer of the petition later stated he had created it to \"bring our broken right side together\" and to \"prop up antifa as a punching bag\".\\n\\nIn 2017, *[Politico](Politico)* interviewed unidentified law enforcement officials who noted a rise in activity since the beginning of the Trump administration, particularly a rise in recruitment and on the part of the far right as well since the Charlottesville [the Right rally](Unite)(Unite the Right rally). One internal assessment acknowledged an inability to penetrate the groups\\' \"diffuse and decentralized organizational structure\". By 2017, the FBI and the DHS reported that they were monitoring suspicious antifa activity in relation to terrorism.\\n\\nDuring the [protests](nationwide)(George Floyd protests) following the [of George Floyd](murder)(murder of George Floyd) in May and June 2020, [General](Attorney)(United States Attorney General) [Barr](William)(William Barr) blamed the violence on \"anarchic and far left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics\" and described the actions of \"Antifa and other similar groups\" as \"domestic terrorism\", echoing similar statements by [Security Advisor](National)(United States National Security Advisor) [C. O\\'Brien](Robert)(Robert C. O\\'Brien). In [posts](Twitter)(Donald Trump on social media) and other statements, Trump blamed \"ANTIFA and the Radical Left\" for violence and repeatedly pledged that the federal government would designate antifa as a \"Terrorist Organization\". However, Trump lacks the authority to do so because under existing law the federal government may designate only [organizations as terrorist](foreign)(United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and antifa is a loosely associated movement rather than a specific organization. Legal experts, among others, believe that designating antifa as a terrorist group would be unconstitutional, raising [Amendment](First)(First Amendment to the United States Constitution) and [process](due)(Due Process Clause) issues. According to historian Mark Bray, antifa cannot be designated as a terrorist organization because \"[t]he groups are loosely organized, and they aren\\'t large enough to cause everything Trump blames them for.\" In addition, Bray argued that the political right has attempted to \"blame everything on antifa\" during the George Floyd protests and that in assuming antifa to be \"predominantly white\", it \"evince[s] a kind of racism that assumes that black people couldn\\'t organize on this deep and wide of a scale.\"\\n\\nOn June 2, 2020, *[Nation](The)(The Nation)* reported on a copy of an FBI [Field Office](Washington)(Washington Field Office) internal situation report it had obtained which stated that the FBI had \"no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence\" in the violent May 31 D.C.-area protests. Two days later, Barr claimed that \"[w]e have evidence that antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity.\" However, the Trump administration has provided no evidence for its claims and there is no evidence that antifa-aligned individuals played a role in instigating the protests or violence, or that antifa played a significant role in the protests. According to Bray, while \"confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance\" during the protests, it is \"impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups.\" As of June 9, 2020, none of the 51 people facing federal charges were alleged to have links to antifa. As of September 16, 2020, no antifa or left-wing group has been charged in connection with the civil unrest.\\n\\nIn an August 2020 interview, Trump asserted \"people that are in the dark shadows\" control his Democratic presidential opponent [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden) and then claimed that \"we had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that\", adding that \"they\\'re people that are on the streets. They\\'re people that are controlling the streets.\" Antifa activists commonly dress in black. Trump\\'s remarks were similar to false social media rumors during preceding months that planes and buses full of antifa gangs were preparing to invade communities, allegedly funded by [Soros](George)(George Soros). Two days after Trump\\'s remarks, Barr asserted he knew antifa activists \"are flying around the country\" and \"we are following them\". However, there is no evidence of any such flight. According to [Reuters](Reuters), \"[l]aw enforcement, intelligence and Congressional officials familiar with official reporting on weeks of protests and related arrests said on Tuesday they were aware of no incidents or reports that would confirm Trump\\'s anecdote.\"\\n\\nIn a September 2020 whistleblower complaint, [Murphy](Brian)(Brian Murphy (agent)), who was the [Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis](Under)(Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis) until August 2020, asserted that DHS secretary [Wolf](Chad)(Chad Wolf) and his deputy [Cuccinelli](Ken)(Ken Cuccinelli) instructed him \"to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and \\'anarchist\\' groups.\" On September 18, 2020, Trump publicly criticized FBI Director [A. Wray](Christopher)(Christopher A. Wray) and hinted that he could fire him over Wray\\'s testimony about antifa and [interference in the 2020 United States elections](Russian)(Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections).\\n\\nOn September 25, 2020, the [campaign](Trump)(Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign) released details of a \"Platinum Plan for Black America\", under which \"Antifa\" and the [Klux Klan](Ku)(Ku Klux Klan) would be prosecuted as terrorist organizations.\\n\\n## Hoaxes and conspiracy theories\\n\\n[theories](Conspiracy)(Conspiracy theories) about antifa that tend to incorrectly portray antifa as a single organization with leaders and secret sources of funding have been spread by [right-wing](right-wing) activists, media organizations and politicians, including [administration](Trump)(Trump administration) officials and the [Trump campaign](2020)(2020 Trump campaign).\\n\\n### #PunchWhiteWomen (2017)\\n\\nIn August 2017, a #PunchWhiteWomen photo hoax campaign was spread by fake antifa Twitter accounts. [Bellingcat](Bellingcat) researcher [Higgins](Eliot)(Eliot Higgins) discovered an image of British actress [Friel](Anna)(Anna Friel) portraying a battered woman in a 2007 [Aid](Women\\'s)(Women\\'s Aid) anti-domestic violence campaign that had been re-purposed using fake antifa Twitter accounts organized by way of [4chan](4chan). The image is captioned \"53% of white women voted for Trump, 53% of white women should look like this\" and includes an antifa flag. Another image featuring an injured woman is captioned \"She chose to be a Nazi. Choices have consequences\" and includes the hashtag #PunchANazi. Higgins remarked to the [BBC](BBC) that \"[t]his was a transparent and quite pathetic attempt, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if white nationalist groups try to mount more sophisticated attacks in the future\". A similar fake image circulated on social media after the [the Right rally](Unite)(Unite the Right rally) in 2017. The doctored image, actually from a 2009 riot in [Athens](Athens), was altered to make it look like someone wearing an antifa symbol attacking a policeman with a flag. After the [Las Vegas shooting](2017)(2017 Las Vegas shooting), similar hoaxes falsely claimed that the shooter was an antifa \"member\"; another such hoax involved a fake antifa Twitter account praising the shooting. Another high-profile fake antifa account was banned from Twitter after it posted with a geotag originating in Russia. Those fake antifa accounts have been repeatedly reported on as real by right-leaning media outlets.\\n\\n### \"Antifa civil war\" (2017)\\n\\nIn October 2017, a conspiracy theory claiming that antifa groups were planning a violent insurrection or [war](civil)(Second American Civil War) the following month spread on [YouTube](YouTube) and was advanced by far-right figures including [Jones](Alex)(Alex Jones), [Wintrich](Lucian)(Lucian Wintrich), [Joseph Watson](Paul)(Paul Joseph Watson), and [Crowder](Steven)(Steven Crowder). The basis for the conspiracy theory was a series of [against Donald Trump](protests)(protests against Donald Trump) organized by the group [Fascism](Refuse)(Refuse Fascism). The protests passed off as planned without causing significant disruption.\\n\\n### \"Antifa Manual\" (2017)\\n\\nA fake \"Antifa Manual\" has circulated online, debunked by [Snopes](Snopes) in 2017. According to the ADL, the language used in the document appears designed to sow division and features many statements that do not align with the sentiments of anti-fascist organizers, often clumsily mimicking \"left wing\" rhetoric. The same images continued to be shared on social media in posts about the [Black Lives Matter protests](2020)(2020–21 United States racial unrest), including a Twitter post by [alt-lite](alt-lite) conspiracy theorist [Posobiec](Jack)(Jack Posobiec).\\n\\n### 8chan list (2018)\\n\\n### George Floyd protests (2020)\\n\\nDuring the nationwide [Floyd protests](George)(George Floyd protests) against police brutality and racism in May and June 2020, false claims of impending antifa activity circulated through social media platforms, causing alarm in at least 41 towns and cities. On May 31, 2020, @ANTIFA_US, a newly created Twitter account, attempted to incite violence relating to the protests. The next day, after determining that it was linked to the white nationalist group [Evropa](Identity)(Identity Evropa), Twitter suspended the fake account. The [FBI](FBI)\\'s Washington Field Office report stated that members of a far-right group on social media had \"called for far-right provocateurs to attack federal agents, use automatic weapons against protesters\" during the [protests](D.C.-area)(George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C.) over Floyd\\'s murder on May 31, 2020.\\n\\nConservative news organizations, pro-Trump individuals using social media, and impostor social media accounts propagated false rumors that antifa groups were traveling to small cities, suburbs, and rural communities to instigate unrest during the protests. In May and June 2020, [Logan](Lara)(Lara Logan) repeatedly promoted hoaxes as part of [News](Fox)(Fox News)\\' coverage of antifa, including publishing a false document she described as an antifa battle plan and claiming that a joke about [juggalos](juggalos) was evidence of a clandestine antifa hierarchy. In an appearance on Fox News\\'s *[Ingraham Angle](The)(The Ingraham Angle)* in June 2020, Trump\\'s personal attorney [Giuliani](Rudy)(Rudy Giuliani) claimed that \"Antifa\" as well as \"Black Lives Matter\" and unspecified communists were working together to \"do away with our system of courts\" and \"take your property away and give it to other people\", asserting without evidence that they receive significant funding from an outside source. Giuliani had previously criticized [Soros](George)(George Soros), who has been a frequent [of conspiracy theories](target)(Conspiracy theories about George Soros), claiming he funded such groups and demonstrations.\\n\\nIn June, 2020, the [Highway Patrol](California)(California Highway Patrol)\\'s air unit launched a search for \"antifa buses\" in response to Instagram and Facebook posts showing a van with the slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" written on it. Later in June 2020, a multiracial family on a camping trip in [Washington](Forks,)(Forks, Washington), were accused of being antifa activists, harassed and trapped in their campsite when trees were felled to block the road. In [d\\'Alene, Idaho](Coeur)(Coeur d\\'Alene, Idaho), groups of armed right-wing vigilantes occupied streets in response to false rumors that antifa activists were planning to travel to the city while similar rumors led to threats being made against activists planning peaceful protests in [California](Sonora,)(Sonora, California). In [Falls, Oregon](Klamath)(Klamath Falls, Oregon), hundreds of people, most of whom were armed, assembled in response to false rumors that antifa activists would target the city, spread by a commander in the [Air National Guard](Oregon)(Oregon Air National Guard).\\n\\nIn an August 2020 interview, Trump spread a similar [theory](conspiracy)(conspiracy theory), claiming that \"thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that\" had boarded a plane to Washington, D.C. to disrupt the [Republican National Convention](2020)(2020 Republican National Convention). Also in August 2020, a fake antifa website began to redirect users to the [Biden 2020 presidential campaign](Joe)(Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign) website. Although this has been described as \"clearly a ploy to associate the Democratic Party with antifa\", those on the right seized upon it.\\n\\nA 2021 [of Homeland Security](Department)(Department of Homeland Security) (DHS) internal report found that senior DHS officials had sought to portray the 2020 [in Portland, Oregon](protests)(George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon), without evidence, as an organized effort by antifa to attack government institutions, and had ordered staff to characterize protests as \"Violent Antifa Anarchist Inspired\".\\n\\nA study by [Labs](Zignal)(Zignal Labs) found that unsubstantiated claims of antifa involvement were one of three dominant themes in misinformation and conspiracy theories around the protests, alongside claims that Floyd\\'s murder had been faked and claims of involvement by George Soros. Some of the opposition to antifa activism has also been artificial in nature. Nafeesa Syeed of [News](Bloomberg)(Bloomberg News) reported that \"[t]he most-tweeted link in the [network](Russian-linked)(Russian web brigades) followed by the researchers was a petition to declare Antifa a terrorist group\".\\n\\n### Capitol attack (2021)\\n\\nImmediately after the [storming of the United States Capitol](2021)(2021 storming of the United States Capitol), a false claim that it was a false flag operation staged by antifa to implicate Trump supporters was spread by a number of Trump loyalists including Representative [Brooks](Mo)(Mo Brooks), [Burns](Mark)(Mark Burns (pastor)), [Dobbs](Lou)(Lou Dobbs), California State Senate minority leader [Grove](Shannon)(Shannon Grove), [Ingraham](Laura)(Laura Ingraham), [Lindell](Mike)(Mike Lindell), former [of Alaska](Governor)(Governor of Alaska) [Palin](Sarah)(Sarah Palin), [Attorney General](Texas)(Texas Attorney General) [Paxton](Ken)(Ken Paxton), actor [Sorbo](Kevin)(Kevin Sorbo), [Trump](Eric)(Eric Trump) and [Lin Wood](L.)(L.

Representative [Gosar](Paul)(Paul Gosar) was the first member of Congress to claim that people associated with antifa were responsible for the attack. During Trump\\'s [impeachment trial](second)(Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump), his attorney [van der Veen](Michael)(Michael van der Veen) stated that \"One of the first people arrested was the leader of antifa.\"\\n\\nIn posts on [Parler](Parler), leaders of the [Boys](Proud)(Proud Boys) had disclosed plans to attend the rally wearing \"all black\" clothing associated with antifa activists and arrive \"incognito\" in an apparent effort to shift blame for any violence on antifa.\\n\\nA false claim that a [recognition software](facial)(facial recognition software) company had identified participants in the incursion as antifa activists originated in a report by [Scarborough](Rowan)(Rowan Scarborough) published in *[Washington Times](The)(The Washington Times)*, and was promoted on the U.S. House floor by Representative [Gaetz](Matt)(Matt Gaetz). *The Washington Times* retracted the story and issued a correction the next day.\\n\\nThe FBI said there was no evidence of antifa involvement in the mob incursion.\\n\\nThe conspiracy was also promoted by Republican Senator [Johnson](Ron)(Ron Johnson).Michael M.

A poll released in February 2021 by the American Enterprise Institute found that 30% of Americans (including 50% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats) believe antifa was mostly responsible for the violence that happened in the riots at the U.S. Capitol.

Whereas it fulfilled the requirements of an action led by \"sub-national actors\" with \"violence or threat of violence\", it lacked in particular the \"intentionality of the incident\", that is the \"result of a conscious calculation on the part of the perpetrators.\" LaFree also questioned \"whether antifa can be considered to constitute a \\'group\\' at this point in time\" and stressed \"how complicated it is to distinguish terrorism from other forms of illegal violence\" such as those by antifa supporters.\\n\\nIn June 2020, the think tank [for Strategic and International Studies](Center)(Center for Strategic and International Studies) (CSIS) assembled a database of 893 terrorism incidents in the United States beginning in 1994. An analysis of the database conducted by *[Guardian](The)(The Guardian)* in July 2020 found no murders linked to antifa or anti-fascism since 1994. According to *The Guardian*, the only death resulting from an anti-fascist attack recorded in the database was that of [van Spronsen](Willem)(2019 Tacoma attack), who was shot dead by police while allegedly [firebombing](firebombing) a [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](U.S.)(U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) (ICE) detention center in [Washington](Tacoma,)(Tacoma, Washington) in 2019. In contrast, the study highlighted the fact that 329 people were killed by American white supremacists or other right-wing extremists during the same period. *The Guardian* quoted Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, as saying that \"Antifa is not going around murdering people like rightwing extremists are. It\\'s a false equivalence. I\\'ve at times been critical of antifa for getting into fights with Nazis at rallies and that kind of violence, but I can\\'t think of one case in which an antifa person was accused of murder.\" [Jones](Seth)(Seth Jones (political scientist)), a counter-terrorism expert who led the creation of the CSIS\\'s database, told *The Guardian* that \"[l]eftwing violence has not been a major terrorism threat\" and that \"the most significant domestic terrorism threat comes from white supremacists, anti-government militias and a handful of individuals associated with the \\'boogaloo\\' movement that are attempting to create a civil war in the United States.\"\\n\\nThe CSIS database was updated in October 2020 to include the suspected [of Aaron Danielson](killing)(Killings of Aaron Danielson and Michael Reinoehl) by Michael Reinoehl. In September 2020, when the investigation was still ongoing, Brian Levin said that if Reinoehl was implicated, it would mark the first case in recent history of an antifa supporter being charged with homicide. Reinoehl was charged by Portland police with second-degree murder and was later was shot and killed by a federally led fugitive task force near [Washington](Lacey,)(Lacey, Washington).Baker, Mike; Golden, Hallie; Goldman, Adam (September 3, 2020).

       "  'answer': \"Antifa in the United States is a decentralized, leaderless movement composed of autonomous groups and individuals united by opposition to fascism, racism, white supremacy, and far-right extremism. Most adherents subscribe to a range of left-wing ideologies, including anarchism, communism, and socialism, often holding anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and anti-state views. While the majority of antifa activism is nonviolent—encompassing protests, community organizing, mutual aid, and digital activism—some participants engage in confrontational or violent tactics such as doxing, harassment, property damage, and occasional physical altercations, particularly against groups or individuals perceived as fascist or white supremacist.\\n\\nThe modern American antifa movement traces its roots to European anti-fascist actions, punk subcultures, and organizations such as Anti-Racist Action in the late 20th century. It gained increased prominence following the 2016 election of Donald Trump, with notable involvement in protests against far-right events, such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and the Berkeley protests. While antifa's confrontational approach has drawn both support and criticism—praised by some as necessary self-defense against rising far-right violence, and condemned by others (including both Democratic and Republican leaders) as counterproductive or dangerous—studies and law enforcement assessments have consistently found that antifa is not a significant domestic terrorism threat, especially when compared to the far greater violence perpetrated by right-wing extremists.\\n\\nPublic discourse around antifa has been marked by misinformation and politicization. Right-wing politicians and media have frequently sought to label antifa as a terrorist organization or portray it as a highly organized, violent group, despite its decentralized structure and the lack of evidence for such claims. Numerous hoaxes and conspiracy theories—often originating from far-right online communities—have fueled public fears, especially during periods of unrest such as the 2020 George Floyd protests and the 2021 Capitol attack, despite repeated findings from academics, journalists, and federal agencies that antifa is neither a cohesive organization nor a major source of violence in the United States.\",\n",

It occurred from August 1936 to March 1938.\\n\\nFollowing the [death](Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin) of [Lenin](Vladimir)(Vladimir Lenin) in 1924, a [vacuum](power)(power vacuum) opened in the Communist Party, the ruling party in the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union) (USSR). Various established figures in Lenin\\'s government attempted to succeed him. Joseph Stalin, the party\\'s General Secretary, outmaneuvered political opponents and ultimately gained control of the party by 1928. Initially, Stalin\\'s leadership was widely accepted; his main political adversary Trotsky was forced into exile in 1929, and the doctrine of \"[in one country](socialism)(socialism in one country)\" became enshrined party policy. However, by the early 1930s, party officials began losing faith in his leadership following the human cost of the [five-year plan](first)(first five-year plan) and the [of agriculture](collectivization)(Collective farming). By 1934 several of Stalin\\'s rivals, such as Trotsky, began calling for Stalin\\'s removal and attempted to break his influence over the party. New Orleans |date=12 September 2018 |language=en}}\\n\\nIn this atmosphere of doubt and suspicion, a popular high-ranking official, [Kirov](Sergei)(Sergei Kirov), was [assassinated](Assassination of Sergei Kirov). His death led to an investigation that revealed a network of party members supposedly working against Stalin, including several of Stalin\\'s rivals. Many of those arrested after Kirov\\'s assassination also confessed plans to kill Stalin himself, including high-ranking party officials. The validity of these claims is still debated by historians, but there is consensus that Kirov\\'s death was the flashpoint where Stalin took action and began the purges.\\n\\nBy 1936, Stalin\\'s paranoia reached its peak. The fear of losing his position and the potential return of Trotsky drove him into authorizing the Great Purge. The purges themselves were largely conducted by the [NKVD](NKVD) (People\\'s Commissariat for Internal Affairs), the secret police of the USSR. The NKVD began the removal of the central party leadership, [Bolshevik](Old)(Old Bolshevik)s, government officials, and regional party [bosses](Political boss). Eventually, the purges were expanded to the [Army](Red)(Red Army) and military high command, which had a disastrous effect on the military. Three successive [were held in Moscow](trials)(Moscow trials) that removed most of the Old Bolsheviks and the challenges to Stalin\\'s position. As the scope of the purge began widening, the omnipresent suspicion of saboteurs and [counter-revolutionaries](Counter-revolutionary) began impacting civilian life. The NKVD began targeting certain [minorities](ethnic)(Soviet Union#Nationalities and ethnic groups) such as the [Germans](Volga)(Volga Germans), who were subjected to forced deportation and extreme repression. During its [operations](mass)(Mass operations of the NKVD), the NKVD widely utilized imprisonment, torture, violent interrogation, and arbitrary executions to solidify control over civilians through fear.\\n\\nIn 1938, Stalin reversed his stance on the purges and declared that the internal enemies had been removed. Stalin criticized the NKVD for carrying out mass executions and subsequently executed [Yagoda](Genrikh)(Genrikh Yagoda) and [Yezhov](Nikolai)(Nikolai Yezhov), who headed the NKVD during the purge years. Despite the Great Purge being over, the atmosphere of mistrust and widespread surveillance continued for decades after. Scholars estimate the death toll for the Great Purge (1936–1938) to be roughly 700,000. The term *great purge* itself was popularized by the historian [Conquest](Robert)(Robert Conquest) in his 1968 book *[Great Terror](The)(The Great Terror (book))*. Conquest\\'s title itself was an [allusion](allusion) to the period from the [Revolution](French)(French Revolution) known as the [of Terror](Reign)(Reign of Terror). While the Soviet government desired to put Trotsky on trial during the purge, his exile prevented this. Trotsky survived the purge, though he would be assassinated in 1940 by the NKVD on the orders of Stalin.

The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: [intelligentsia](intelligentsia), peasants—especially those lending out money or wealth ([*kulaks*](kulak))—and professionals.\\n\\nA series of [NKVD](NKVD) operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[fifth-column](fifth column)\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage by the [Military Organisation](Polish)(Polish Military Organisation) and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [citizens of Polish origin](Soviet)(Polish Operation of the NKVD).\\n\\nAccording to [Khrushchev](Nikita)(Nikita Khrushchev)\\'s 1956 speech, \"[the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences](On)(On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences)\", and to historian [Conquest](Robert)(Robert Conquest), a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [show trial](Moscow)(Moscow Trials)s, were based on [confession](forced)(forced confession)s, often obtained through [torture](torture), and on loose interpretations of [58 of the RSFSR Penal Code](Article)(Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)), which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [troika](NKVD)(NKVD troika)s.\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [wrecking](Wrecking (Soviet crime)), [sabotage](sabotage), [agitation](anti-Soviet)(anti-Soviet agitation), conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups). They were quickly executed by shooting or sent to the [Gulag](Gulag) [camp](labor)(labor camp)s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of [van](gas)(Soviet gas van)s to kill the victims during their transportation to the [firing range](Butovo)(Butovo firing range) has been documented.This information was published first in 1990 in a *[Pravda](Komsomolskaya)(Komsomolskaya Pravda)* article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The campaigns were carried out according to the [line of the party](general)(general line (party)), often by direct orders of the [politburo](Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) headed by Stalin.Goldman, W. (2005). \"Stalinist Terror and Democracy: The 1937 Union Campaign\". *The American Historical Review*, 110(5), 1427–53\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [collectivization of peasants](forced)(Collectivization in the Soviet Union) and the resulting [of 1932–1933](famine)(Soviet famine of 1932–1933), as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin\\'s and generally Soviet perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. Forged documents and misinformation spread by [Germany](Nazi)(Nazi Germany) in order to incriminate innocent Soviet citizens also contributed to this perception. Stalin began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\"Hagenloh, Paul. 2000. \"Socially Harmful Elements and the Great Terror.\" pp. 286–307 in *Stalinism: New Directions*, edited by [Fitzpatrick](S.)(Sheila Fitzpatrick). London: Routledge.Shearer, David. 2003. \"Social Disorder, Mass Repression and the NKVD During the 1930s.\" pp. 85–117 in \\'\\'Stalin\\'s Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union,* edited by B. McLaughlin and K. McDermott. Basingstoke: [MacMillan](Palgrave)(Palgrave MacMillan).\\n\\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|[Trotsky](Leon)(Leon Trotsky), in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\\n\\nThe term \"[purge](purge)\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression *purge of the Party ranks*. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\\n\\nAccording to an October 1993 study published in *[American Historical Review](The)(The American Historical Review)\\'\\', much of the Great Purge was directed against the widespread banditry and criminal activity which was occurring in the Soviet Union at the time. The political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [Trotsky](Leon)(Leon Trotsky) and [Bukharin](Nikolai)(Nikolai Bukharin), respectively. Following the [War](Civil)(Russian Civil War) and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin\\'s opponents inside the Communist Party chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption.\\n\\nThis opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [affair](Ryutin)(Ryutin affair) seemed to vindicate Stalin\\'s suspicions. [Ryutin](Martemyan Ryutin) was working with the even larger secret [Bloc](Opposition)(Bloc of Soviet Oppositions) in which [Trotsky](Leon)(Leon Trotsky) and [Zinoviev](Grigori)(Grigory Zinoviev) participated,. and which later led to both of their deaths. Stalin enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [centralism](democratic)(democratic centralism).\\n\\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [Tukhachevsky](Mikhail)(Mikhail Tukhachevsky) and [Kun](Béla)(Béla Kun), as well as the majority of Lenin\\'s Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky\\'s family before [killing](Leon Trotsky#Assassination) him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [Mercader](Ramón)(Ramón Mercader) was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [Sudoplatov](Pavel)(Pavel Sudoplatov), under the personal orders of Stalin.\\n\\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[Leningrad](Saint Petersburg) party leader [Kirov](Sergei)(Sergey Kirov) with [Stalin](Joseph Stalin) (and his daughter [Svetlana](Svetlana Alliluyeva)) in 1934.]]\\n\\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [Kirov](Sergey)(Sergey Kirov) as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see ). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [Party Congress](1934)(17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)) elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov\\'s assassination, the NKVD charged the ever-growing group of former oppositionists with Kirov\\'s murder as well as a growing list of other offenses, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\\n\\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [Molotov](Vyacheslav)(Vyacheslav Molotov) and [Kaganovich](Lazar)(Lazar Kaganovich), participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists. Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.\\n\\nFrom the [Revolution](October)(October Revolution) onward,Robert Gellately, *Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe*, 2007, Knopf, 720 pp.  Lenin had used repression against perceived and legitimate enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating control over the population in a campaign called the [Terror](Red)(Red Terror). As the Russian Civil War drew to a close, this campaign was relaxed although the secret police did remain active. From 1924 to 1928 the mass repression including incarceration in the Gulag system dropped significantly.\\n\\nBy 1929, Stalin had outmaneuvered his political opponents and gained full control over the party. He organized a committee to begin the process of industrialization of the Soviet Union. Backlash against industrialization and collectivization of agriculture escalated which prompted Stalin to increase police presence in rural areas. Soviet authorities increased repression against the kulaks, who were wealthy peasants that owned farmland in a policy called [dekulakization](dekulakization). The kulaks responded by destroying crop yields and other acts of sabotage against the Soviet government. The food shortage created lead to a mass famine across the USSR and slowed the Five Year Plan.\\n\\n[Kopelev](Lev)(Lev Kopelev) wrote \"In Ukraine 1937 began in 1933\", referring to the comparatively early beginning of the Soviet crackdown in Ukraine. A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. In addition to ordinary citizens prominent members of the Communist Party were also targets for the purges. The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole society. Soviet historians organize the Great Purge into three corresponding trials. The following events are used for the demarcation of the period:\\n\\n* 1936, the [Moscow trial](first)(Moscow trials#The \"Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center\").\\n\\n* 1937, introduction of NKVD troikas for implementation of \"revolutionary justice.\"\\n\\n* 1937, passage of Article 58-14 about \"counter-revolutionary sabotage.\"\\n\\n* 1937, the [Moscow trial](second)(Moscow trials#The \"Parallel anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center\")\\n\\n* 1937, the military purge.\\n\\n* 1938, the [Moscow trial](third)(Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\").\\n\\n## Moscow trials\\n\\n### First and second Moscow trials\\n\\n[[File:Л. Д. Троцкий, Л. Б. Каменев и Г. Е. Зиновьев. Середина 1920-х годов.jpg|thumb|right|Bolshevik revolutionaries [Trotsky](Leon)(Leon Trotsky), [Kamenev](Lev)(Lev Kamenev) and [Zinoviev](Grigory)(Grigory Zinoviev)]]\\n\\nBetween 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin\\'s closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\\n\\n* The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc,\" held in August 1936,Rogovin (1998), pp. 17–18 at which the chief defendants were [Zinoviev](Grigory)(Grigory Zinoviev) and [Kamenev](Lev)(Lev Kamenev), two of the most prominent former party leaders, who had indeed been members of a [Bloc](Conspiratorial)(Bloc of Soviet Oppositions) that opposed Stalin, although its activities were exaggerated. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin. After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.Rogovin (1998), pp. 36–38\\n\\n* The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\" which included [Radek](Karl)(Karl Radek), [Piatakov](Yuri)(Yuri Piatakov) and [Sokolnikov](Grigory)(Grigory Sokolnikov), and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\\n\\n* There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including [Tukhachevsky](Mikhail)(Mikhail Tukhachevsky), in June 1937.\\n\\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [OGPU](OGPU) officer [Orlov](Alexander)(Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov) and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners\\' families. For example, Kamenev\\'s teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\\n\\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [Voroshilov](Kliment)(Kliment Voroshilov), and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.\\n\\n#### Dewey Commission\\n\\nIn May 1937, the **Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials**, commonly known as the Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [Dewey](John)(John Dewey). Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky\\'s innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.\\n\\nFor example, [Pyatakov](Georgy)(Georgy Pyatakov) testified that he had flown to [Oslo](Oslo) in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place. Another defendant, [Smirnov](Ivan)(Ivan N. Smirnov), confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\\n\\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled *Not Guilty*. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote\\n\\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\\n\\n#### Implication of the Rightists\\n\\nIn the second trial, [Radek](Karl)(Karl Radek) testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky\\'s] school,\"British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937 as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"\\n\\nBy the \"third organization,\" he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [Rightists](Right Opposition), led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\\n\\n### Third Moscow trial\\n\\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|[NKVD](NKVD) chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions (left to right): [Agranov](Yakov)(Yakov Agranov); [Yagoda](Genrikh)(Genrikh Yagoda); unknown; [Redens](Stanislav)(Stanislav Redens). All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\\n\\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as the [of the Twenty-One](Trial)(Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\"), is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", supposedly led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [International](Communist)(Communist International), former premier [Rykov](Alexei)(Alexei Rykov), [Rakovsky](Christian)(Christian Rakovsky), [Krestinsky](Nikolai)(Nikolai Krestinsky), and [Yagoda](Genrikh)(Genrikh Yagoda), recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\\n\\nAlthough [Opposition Bloc](an)(Bloc of Soviet Oppositions) led by Trotsky and with zinovievites really existed, [Broué](Pierre)(Pierre Broué) asserts that Bukharin was not involved. Differently from Broué, one of his former allies, [Humbert-Droz](Jules)(Jules Humbert-Droz), said in his memoirs that Bukharin told him that he formed a secret bloc with Zinoviev and Kamenev in order to remove Stalin from leadership.\\n\\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [Gorky](Maxim)(Maxim Gorky) by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand its territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other charges.\\n\\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had accepted the earlier trials found it more difficult to accept these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin and [Kalinin](Mikhail Kalinin). No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.Corey Robin, \"Fear\", p. 96 For some prominent communists such as [Wolfe](Bertram)(Bertram Wolfe), [Lovestone](Jay)(Jay Lovestone), [Koestler](Arthur)(Arthur Koestler), and [Brandler](Heinrich)(Heinrich Brandler), the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-communists eventually.Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10 To them, Bukharin\\'s confession symbolized the depredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.\\n\\n#### Bukharin\\'s confession\\n\\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[Bukharin](Nikolai)(Nikolai Bukharin), Russian [Bolshevik](Bolshevik) [revolutionary](Russian Revolution) executed in 1938.]]\\n\\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.\\n\\n[Mikoyan](Anastas)(Anastas Mikoyan) and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.\\n\\nBukharin\\'s confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler\\'s acclaimed novel *[at Noon](Darkness)(Darkness at Noon)* and philosophical essay by [Merleau-Ponty](Maurice)(Maurice Merleau-Ponty) in *Humanism and Terror*. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\\n\\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. One observer noted that after disproving several charges against him, Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case.\"Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No. 141, Moscow, 21 March 1938 He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was based solely on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words:Tucker, Robert. \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites.\" *Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet*. pp. 667–68.[T]he monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.[Rolland](Romain)(Romain Rolland) and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [prisoner massacres](NKVD)(Medvedev Forest massacre) in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin\\'s wife, [Larina](Anna)(Anna Larina), was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [rehabilitated](Rehabilitation (Soviet)) a half-century later by the Soviet state under [Gorbachev](Mikhail)(Mikhail Gorbachev) in 1988.\\n\\n## \"Ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"\\n\\nOn 2 July 1937, in a top secret order to regional Party and NKVD chiefs Stalin instructed them to produce the estimated number of \"kulaks\" and \"criminals\" in their districts. These individuals were to be arrested and executed, or sent to the gulag camps. The party chiefs complied and produced these lists within days, with figures which roughly corresponded to the individuals who were already under secret police surveillance.\\n\\nOn 30 July 1937, the [Order No. 00447](NKVD)(NKVD Order No. 00447) was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [regime](Tsarist)(Russian Empire), former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\\n\\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[settlements](special)(Forced settlements in the Soviet Union)\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([Siberia](Siberia), the [Urals](Ural Mountains), Kazakhstan, and the [North](Far)(Extreme North (Russia))), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [Army](White)(White Army), participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\".\\n\\nHowever, a large number of people were arrested at random in sweeps, on the basis of denunciations or because they were related to, were friends with or knew people already arrested. Engineers, peasants, railwaymen, and other types of workers were arrested during the \"Kulak Operation\" based on the fact that they worked for or near important strategic sites and factories where work accidents had occurred due to \"frantic rhythms and plans\". During this period the NKVD reopened these cases and relabeled them as \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking.\"Werth, Nicolas. 2009. *L’ivrogne et la marchande de fleurs. Autopsie d’un meurtre de masse, 1937–1938*. Paris: Tallandier.\\n\\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|upright=0.7|thumb|[Karlovich Miller](Yevgeny-Ludvig)(Yevgeny Miller), one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\\n\\nThe [clergy](Orthodox)(Russian Orthodox Church), including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (*spetzpereselentsy*) who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.\\n\\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [firing range](Butovo)(Butovo firing range) were charged with a non-political criminal offence.\\n\\nTo carry out the mass arrests, the 25,000 officers of the State Security personnel of NKVD were complemented with units of ordinary police, and [Komsomol](Komsomol) ([Communist League](Young)(Young Communist League)) and civilian Communist Party members. Seeking to fulfill the quotas, the police rounded up people in markets and train stations, with the purpose of arresting \"social outcasts\". Local units of the NKVD, in order to meet their \"casework minimums\" and force confessions out of arrestees worked long uninterrupted shifts during which they interrogated, tortured and beat the prisoners. In many cases those arrested were forced to sign blank pages which were later filled in with a fabricated confession by the interrogators.\\n\\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.\\n\\nThe \"Kulak Operation\" was the largest single campaign of repression in 1937–38, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.\\n\\n## Campaigns targeting nationalities\\n\\n[[File:Izrail Pliner NKVD.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.8|[Pliner](Israil)(Israel Pliner); (1896–1939) chief of [Gulag](Gulag) [NKVD](NKVD) (1937–1938), later himself arrested and executed in 1939]]\\n\\nA series of [operations of the NKVD](mass)(mass operations of the NKVD) was carried out from 1937 through 1938 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, on the order of [Yezhov](Nikolai)(Nikolai Yezhov).\\n\\nThe [operation of the NKVD](Polish)(Polish operation of the NKVD) was the largest of this kind. The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records. Snyder estimates that at least eighty-five thousand of them were ethnic Poles. The remainder were \\'suspected\\' of being Polish, without further inquiry.\\n\\nPoles comprised 12.5% of those who were killed during the Great Terror, while comprising only 0.4% of the population. Overall, national minorities targeted in these campaigns composed 36% of the victims of the Great Purge, despite being only 1.6% of the Soviet Union\\'s population. 74% of ethnic minorities arrested during the Great Purge were executed while those sentenced during the Kulak Operation had only a 50% chance of being executed, (though this may have been due to the Gulag camp\\'s lack of space in the late stages of the Purge rather than deliberate discrimination in sentencing).\\n\\nThe wives and children of those arrested and executed were dealt with by the [Order No. 00486](NKVD)(NKVD Order No. 00486). The women were sentenced to forced labour for 5 or 10 years. Their minor children were put in orphanages. All possessions were confiscated. Extended families were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well, affecting up to 200,000–250,000 people of Polish background depending on the size of their families.\\n\\nThe NKVD national operations were conducted on a quota system using [procedure](album)(album procedure). The officials were mandated to arrest and execute a specific number of so-called \"counter-revolutionaries\", compiled by administration using various statistics but also telephone books with names sounding non-Russian.\\n\\nThe [Operation of the NKVD](Polish)(Polish Operation of the NKVD) served as a model for a series of similar NKVD secret decrees targeting a number of the Soviet Union\\'s diaspora nationalities: the [Finnish](Finns), [Latvian](Latvian people), [Estonian](Estonian people), [Bulgaria](Bulgaria)n, [Afghan](Afghan people), [Iranian](Iranian peoples), [Greek](Greek people), and [Chinese](Chinese people). Of the operations against national minorities, it was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of the number of victims. According to [Snyder](Timothy)(Timothy Snyder), ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country\\'s population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.[Timothy](Snyder,)(Timothy Snyder). 2010. *[Europe Between Hitler and Stalin](Bloodlands:)(Bloodlands)*.

Timothy Snyder attributes 300,000 deaths during the Great Purge to \"national terror\" including ethnic minorities and Ukrainian Kulaks who survived the early 1930s.Timothy Snyder, *Bloodlands*, Basic Books, 2010, pp. 411–12\\n\\nConcerning diaspora minorities, the vast majority of whom were Soviet citizens and whose ancestors had resided for decades and sometimes centuries in the Soviet Union and Russian Empire, \"this designation absolutized their cross-border ethnicities as the only salient aspect of their identity, sufficient proof of their disloyalty and sufficient justification for their arrest and execution\" (Martin, 2001: 338). Some scholars have called the National Operations of the NKVD [genocidal](genocidal).[\"The Crime of Genocide Committed against the Poles by the USSR before and during World War II: An International Legal Study\"](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&context=jil) by Karol Karski, Case Western Reserve *Journal of International Law*, Vol. 45, 2013 [Naimark](Norman)(Norman Naimark) called Stalin\\'s policy towards Poles in the 1930s \"[genocidal](genocidal);\" however he doesn\\'t consider the Great Purge entirely genocidal because it also targeted political opponents.\\n\\nMost scholars, however, focus on the security dilemma in the border areas suggesting the need to secure the ethnic integrity of Soviet space *vis-à-vis* neighboring capitalistic enemy states. They stress the role of [relations](international)(international relations) and believe that representatives of these minorities were killed not because of their ethnicity, but because of their possible relations to countries hostile to the USSR and fear of disloyalty in the case of an invasion. Nevertheless, little proof exists to suggest that Russia\\'s and Stalin\\'s alleged prejudices played a central causal role in the Great Purge.\\n\\n## Purge of the army\\n\\n[[File:5marshals 01.jpg|thumb|The first five [of the Soviet Union](Marshals)(Marshal of the Soviet Union) in November 1935.

Only Budyonny and Voroshilov survived the Great Purge.]]\\n\\nThe purge of the [Army](Red)(Red Army) and [Maritime Fleet](Military)(Soviet Navy) removed three of five [marshals](Marshal of the Soviet Union) (then equivalent to four-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 57 army [corps](corps) commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army [commissar](commissar)s, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.\\n\\nAt first, it was thought 25–50% of Red Army officers had been purged; the true figure is now known to be in the area of 3.7–7.7%. This discrepancy was the result of a systematic underestimation of the true size of the Red Army officer corps, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. Thirty percent of officers purged in 1937–1939 were allowed to return to service.Stephen Lee, *European Dictatorships 1918–1945,* p. 56.\\n\\nThe purge of the army was claimed to be supported by German-forged documents (said to have been correspondence between Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command). The claim is unsupported by facts, as by the time the documents were supposedly created, two people from the eight in the Tukhachevsky group were already imprisoned, and by the time the document was said to reach Stalin the purging process was already underway.  However the actual evidence introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions.\\n\\nThe purge had a significant effect on German decision making in [War II](World)(World War II): many German generals opposed an invasion of Russia, but [Hitler](Hitler) disagreed, arguing that the Red Army was less effective after its intellectual leadership had been eliminated in the purge.\"Despite the fact that the combined firepower of the Red Army was greater than that of the Germans, the Purges had effectively crippled it by destroying the officer corps. This was the decisive element which persuaded Hitler to attack in 1941. At the Nuremberg trial, Marshal Keitel testified that many German generals had warned Hitler not to attack Russia, arguing that the Red Army was a formidable opponent. Rejecting these Hitler gave Keitel his main reason \\'The first-class high-ranking officers were wiped out by Stalin in 1937, and the new generation cannot yet provide the brains they need.\\'\" [Medvedev](Roy)(Roy Medvedev), *[History Judge](Let)(Let History Judge)*, p. 214\\n\\n## Wider purge\\n\\nEventually almost all of the [Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks) who had played prominent roles during the [Revolution](Russian)(Russian Revolution), or in Lenin\\'s Soviet government, were executed. Out of six members of the original [Politburo](Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) during the [Revolution](October)(October Revolution) who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive. Four of the other five were executed; the fifth, [Trotsky](Leon)(Leon Trotsky), had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent [Mercader](Ramón)(Ramón Mercader) in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin\\'s death in 1924, four were executed, one ([Tomsky](Mikhail Tomsky)) committed suicide, and two (Molotov and [Kalinin](Mikhail Kalinin)) lived.\\n\\nWhile being the most visible part, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik leaders were only a minor aspect of the purges. A series of documents discovered in the Central Committee archives in 1992 by [Bukovsky](Vladimir)(Vladimir Bukovsky) demonstrate that there were limits for arrests and executions as for all other activities in the planned economy.\\n\\nThe victims were convicted [absentia](in)(Trial in absentia) and in camera by extrajudicial organs—the [troika](NKVD)(NKVD troika)s sentenced indigenous \"enemies\" under [Order No. 00447](NKVD)(NKVD Order No. 00447) and the two-man dvoiki (NKVD Commissar [Yezhov](Nikolai)(Nikolai Yezhov) and Main State Prosecutor [Vyshinsky](Andrey)(Andrey Vyshinsky), or their deputies) those arrested along national lines. A characteristic of all the [operations of the NKVD](mass)(mass operations of the NKVD) was flexibility: first, the numbers—the so-called limit—could be easily increased; second, it was left entirely to the NKVD officers whether a particular prisoner was to be shot or sent to the prison camps; third, the time-limits set for the completion of single operations were extended time and again.\\n\\nThe victims were executed at night, either in prisons, in the cellars of NKVD headquarters, or in a secluded area, usually a forest. The NKVD officers shot prisoners in the head using pistols.\\n\\n### Intelligentsia\\n\\n[[Image:NKVD Mandelstam.jpg|thumb|right|1938 NKVD arrest photo of the poet [Mandelstam](Osip)(Osip Mandelstam), who died in a labor camp.]]\\n\\n[[Image:Babel NKWD.png|right|thumb|The NKVD photo of writer [Babel](Isaac)(Isaac Babel) made after his arrest.]]\\n\\n[[Image:MeyerholdMug.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre director [Meyerhold](Vsevolod)(Vsevolod Meyerhold) at the time of his arrest.]]\\n\\n[[Image:Vavilov in prison.jpg|thumb|right|Botanist [Vavilov](Nikolai)(Nikolai Vavilov)\\'s photo, taken at the time of his arrest.]]\\n\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, 2,000 writers, intellectuals, and artists were imprisoned and 1,500 died in prisons and concentration camps.

Buddhist [lama](lama)s made up the majority of victims, with 18,000 being killed in the terror. Other victims were nobility and political and academic figures, along with some ordinary workers and herders.Christopher Kaplonski, \"[Thirty thousand bullets](http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/bullets.pdf)\", in: *Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe*, London, 2002, pp. 155–68 Mass graves containing hundreds of executed Buddhist monks and civilians have been discovered as recently as 2003.\\n\\n### Xinjiang Great Purge\\n\\nThe pro-Soviet leader [Shicai](Sheng)(Sheng Shicai) of [Xinjiang](Xinjiang) province in China launched his own purge in 1937 to coincide with Stalin\\'s Great Purge. The [War (1937)](Xinjiang)(Xinjiang War (1937)) broke out amid the purge.Allen S. Whiting and General Sheng Shicai. \"Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot?\" Michigan State University Press, 1958 Sheng received assistance from the NKVD. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a \"Fascist Trotskyite plot\" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General [Hushan](Ma)(Ma Hushan), [Shaowu](Ma)(Ma Shaowu), Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and [Hoja-Niyaz](Hoja-Niyaz) were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control.\\n\\n## Timeline\\n\\nThe Great Purge of 1936–1938 can be roughly divided into four periods:\\n\\n; October 1936 – February 1937: Reforming the security organizations, adopting official plans on purging the elites.\\n\\n; March – June 1937: Purging the elites; adopting plans for the mass repressions against the \"social base\" of the potential aggressors, starting of purging the \"elites\" from opposition.\\n\\n; July 1937 – October 1938: Mass repressions against \"kulaks\", \"dangerous\" ethnic minorities, family members of oppositionists, military officers, saboteurs in agriculture and industry.\\n\\n; November 1938 – 1939: Stopping of mass operations, abolishing of many organs of extrajudicial executions, repressions against some organizers of mass repressions.\\n\\n## End\\n\\nIn the summer of 1938, Yezhov was relieved from his post as head of the NKVD and was eventually tried and executed. [Beria](Lavrentiy)(Lavrentiy Beria) succeeded him as head. On 17 November 1938, a joint decree of [Sovnarkom](Sovnarkom) USSR and [Committee](Central)(Central Committee) of VKP(b) ([about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation](Decree)(Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation)) and the subsequent order of the NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the [orders of systematic repression](NKVD)(Mass operations of the NKVD) and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges. When Yezhov was executed, Stalin claimed in a private conversation with [Yakovlev](Aleksandr)(Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev) that it was because he had killed many innocent people.\\n\\nMichael Parrish argues that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s. [Solzhenitsyn](Aleksandr)(Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn) (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in *[Gulag Archipelago](The)(The Gulag Archipelago)* his view of the timeline of *all* the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918–1956), in which the 1936–1938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity—the intelligentsia—by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the [five-year plan](first)(first five-year plan) of 1928–1933\\'s collectivization and [dekulakization](dekulakization), were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.\\n\\nIn some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria. Some examples include Marshal of the Soviet Union [Yegorov](Alexander)(Alexander Yegorov (military)), arrested in April 1938 and shot (or died from torture) in February 1939 (his wife, G. A. Yegorova, was shot in August 1938); Army Commander [Fedko](Ivan)(Ivan Fedko), arrested July 1938 and shot February 1939; Flagman Konstantin Dushenov, arrested May 1938 and shot February 1940; Komkor [I. Bondar](G.)(Georgy Bondar), arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously [rehabilitated](rehabilitation (Soviet)).\\n\\n[[File:Kosior.jpg|thumb|182x182px|Polish-born Soviet politician [Kosior](Stanislav)(Stanislav Kosior), a contributor to the [famine in Ukraine](1932–33)(Holodomor), was executed in 1939.]]\\n\\nWhen the relatives of those who had been executed in 1937–1938 inquired about their fate, they were told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to \"ten years [the right of correspondence](without)(without the right of correspondence)\" (десять лет без права переписки). When these ten-year periods elapsed in 1947–1948 but the arrested did not appear, the relatives asked [MGB](Ministry for State Security (USSR)) about their fate again and this time were told that the arrested died in imprisonment.\\n\\n## Western reactions\\n\\nAlthough the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, [Sartre](Jean-Paul)(Jean-Paul Sartre) took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not be discouraged. A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates\\' testimony.\\n\\nAccording to [Conquest](Robert)(Robert Conquest) in his 1968 book \\'\\'The Great Terror: Stalin\\'s Purge of the Thirties*, with respect to the trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unintentionally or intentionally ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, notably [Duranty](Walter)(Walter Duranty) of *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)*, a Russian speaker; the American Ambassador, [E. Davies](Joseph)(Joseph E. Davies), who reported, \"proof&nbsp;... beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of treason\"; and [Beatrice](Beatrice Webb) and [Webb](Sidney)(Sidney Webb), authors of *Soviet Communism: A New Civilization*. While \"Communist Parties everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line\", some of the most critical reporting also came from the left, notably *[Manchester Guardian](The)(The Guardian)\\'\\'. The American journalist [R. Knickerbocker](H.)(H. R. Knickerbocker) also reported on the executions. He called them in 1941 \"the great purges\", and described how over four years they affected \"the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists\". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\"\\n\\nEvidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin\\'s death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the [Party USA](Communist)(Communist Party USA) newspaper, the *[Worker](Daily)(Daily Worker)*, who, following the lead of *The New York Times*, published the [Speech](Secret)(On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences) in full.\\n\\n## Rehabilitation\\n\\n[[Soviet Union 1963 CPA 2824 stamp (Russian Civil War Hero Marshal of the Soviet Union Mikhail Tukhachevsky.

In his secret speech to the [20th](20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) [CPSU](Communist Party of the Soviet Union) congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. Khrushchev later claimed in his memoirs that he had initiated the process, overcoming objections and protests from the rest of Party leadership, but the transcripts belie this, although they show differences of opinion regarding the contents. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[rehabilitated](Rehabilitation (Soviet))\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [Rudzutak](Yan)(Yan Rudzutak) and [Kosior](Stanislav)(Stanislav Kosior) and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [theory](Marxist)(Marxist theory), was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book *Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s–50s* (Реабилитация. Политические процессы 30-50-х годов) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how numerous show trials were fabricated.\\n\\n## Number of people executed\\n\\nOfficial figures put the total number of documentable executions during the years 1937 and 1938 at 681,692, in addition to 116,000 deaths in the [Gulag](Gulag), and 2,000 unofficially killed in non-article 58 shootings; whereas the total estimate of deaths brought about by Soviet repression during the Great Purge ranges from 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag, as a result of their treatment therein.\\n\\nAccording to [Conquest](Robert)(Robert Conquest), a practice of falsification for lowering the execution numbers was disguising executions with the sentence \"ten years [the right of correspondence](without)(without the right of correspondence)\" which almost always meant execution. All of the bodies identified from the mass graves at [Vinnitsa](Vinnytsia massacre) and [Kuropaty](Kuropaty) were of individuals who had received this sentence.Robert Conquest, *The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition*, Oxford University Press, US, 2007. p. 287 Despite this, the lower figure did roughly confirm Conquest\\'s original 1968 estimate of 700,000 \"legal\" executions and in the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of *The Great Terror*, Conquest claimed that he had been \"correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million\".Robert Conquest, Preface, *The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition*, Oxford University Press, US, 2007. p. xvi\\n\\nAccording to [Arch Getty](J.)(J. Arch Getty) and Oleg V. Naumov, \"popular estimates of executions in the great purges vary from 500,000 to 7 million.\" However, according to them, \"the archival evidence from the secret police rejects the astronomically high estimates often given for the number of terror victims\" and \"the data available at this point make it clear that the number shot in the two worst purge years [1937–38] was more likely in the hundreds of thousands than in the millions.\" According to historian Corrina Kuhr, 700,000 people were executed during the Great Purge out of the 2.5 million who were arrested. Professor Nérard François-Xavier estimates the same number of people who were sentenced to death; however, he states that 1.3 million people were arrested.\\n\\nThe Soviets themselves made their own estimates with [Molotov](Vyacheslav)(Vyacheslav Molotov) saying \"The report written by that commission member…says that 1,370,000 arrests were made in the 1930s. That\\'s too many. I responded that the figures should be thoroughly reviewed\".Chuev, Feliks. *Molotov Remembers*. Chicago: I. R. Dee, 1993, p. 285\\n\\n[[archive 910794 Memorial events in Bykovnya Graves reserve.jpg|thumb|Memorial events in Bykovnya Graves reserve.](File:RIAN)]\\n\\n## Stalin\\'s role\\n\\n[[File:Great_Purge_Stalin_Voroshilov_Kaganovich_Zhdanov_Molotov.jpg|thumb|upright|A list from the Great Purge signed by [Molotov](Vyacheslav Molotov), [Stalin](Joseph Stalin), [Voroshilov](Kliment Voroshilov), [Kaganovich](Lazar Kaganovich), and [Zhdanov](Andrei Zhdanov)]]\\n\\nHistorians with archival access have confirmed that Stalin was intimately involved in the purge. Russian historian [V. Khlevniuk](Oleg)(Oleg Khlevniuk) states \"theories about the elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central control over the course of mass repression, and about the role of regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by the historical record\".Oleg V. Khlevniuk. *Master of the House: Stalin and His Inner Circle.* [University Press](Yale)(Yale University Press), 2008.  p. xix Besides signing Yezhov\\'s lists, Stalin sometimes gave instructions concerning certain individuals. In one instance, he told Yezhov \"Isn\\'t it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?\" In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov\\'s lists, he added to M. I. Baranov\\'s name, \"beat, beat!\"Marc Jansen, Nikita Vasilʹevich Petrov. \\'\\'Stalin\\'s Loyal Executioner: People\\'s Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940.* [Institution Press](Hoover)(Hoover Institution Press), 2002.  p. 111 Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% of these are confirmed to have been shot, this was 7.4% of those executed legally.Getty & Naumov, *The Road to Terror\\'\\'. New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univ. Press, 1999, p. 470 While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered to no one in particular: \"Who\\'s going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the [boyars](boyars) [the Terrible](Ivan)(Ivan the Terrible) got rid of? No one.\"Quoted in [Volkogonov](Dmitri)(Dmitri Volkogonov), *Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy* (New York, 1991), p. 210.\\n\\nIt is quite possible that Yezhov misled Stalin about the aspects of the purge process. Many people at the time, and also a few subsequent commentators, surmised that the Great Purge wasn\\'t started by Stalin\\'s initiative, so the idea got about that the process was entirely out of control once it had begun. Stalin may have failed to anticipate the catastrophic excesses of the NKVD under Yezhov. Stalin also objected to the large numbers of people that Yezhov was purging. For example, when Yezhov announced that 200,000 party members were expelled, Stalin interrupted him, said that they were \"very many\" and suggested instead to only expel 30,000 and 600 former [Trotskyists](Trotskyism) and [Zinovievist](Zinovievist)s which \"would be a bigger victory\".\\n\\n[G. Wheatcroft](Stephen)(Stephen G. Wheatcroft) posits that while the \\'purposive deaths\\' caused by Hitler constitute \\'murder\\', those caused under Stalin fall into the category of \\'execution\\', although in terms of \"causing death by criminal neglect and ruthlessness (...) Stalin probably exceeded Hitler\". Wheatcroft elaborates:\\n\\nStalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterrent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.\\n\\n## Soviet investigation commissions\\n\\n[[archive 749019 Opening of monument to victims of political repressions.jpg|thumb|upright|Opening of monument to victims of political repressions, Moscow, 1990](File:RIAN)]\\n\\nAt least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin\\'s death. The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, [Suslov](Mikhail Suslov), [Furtseva](Furtseva), [Shvernik](Nikolay Shvernik), [Aristov](Averky Aristov), [Pospelov](Pospelov), and [Rudenko](Roman Rudenko). They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956–1957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky *et al.* should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\\n\\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[Commission](Shvernik)(Shvernik Commission)\"). It included [Shelepin](Alexander Shelepin), Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek\\'s materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\\n\\nStalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....\\n\\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value. We were not idiots.\" and that \"the cases were reviewed and some people were released\"Chuev, Feliks. *Molotov Remembers*. Chicago: I. R. Dee, 1993, pp. 276, 294\\n\\n[[of sorrow at the first exhibition of the victims of Stalinism in Moscow.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Wall of sorrow\" at the first exhibition of the victims of Stalinism in Moscow, 19 November 1988](File:Wall)]\\n\\n## Mass graves and memorials\\n\\nIn the late 1980s, with the formation of the [Society](Memorial)(Memorial Society) and similar organisations across the Soviet Union at a time of [Gorbachev](Mikhail Gorbachev)\\'s [glasnost](glasnost) (\"openness and transparency\") it became possible not only to speak about the Great Terror but to begin locating the killing grounds of 1937–1938 and identifying those who lay buried there.\\n\\nIn 1988, for instance, the mass graves at [Kurapaty](Kurapaty) in Belarus were the site of a clash between demonstrators and the police. In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [prison camp](Solovki)(Solovki prison camp) in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites. Some, such as the [Bykivnia](Bykivnia) killing fields near [Kyiv](Kyiv), are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.\\n\\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism. Between August 1937 and October 1938, more than 20,000 people were shot and buried there.\\n\\nOn 30 October 2017, President Vladimir Putin opened the [of Sorrow](Wall)(Wall of Sorrow), an official but controversial recognition of the crimes of the Soviet regime.\\n\\nIn August 2021, a mass grave containing between 5,000 and 8,000 skeletons was discovered in [Odesa](Odesa), Ukraine, during exploration works for a planned expansion of [International Airport](Odesa)(Odesa International Airport). The graves are believed to date back to the late 1930s during the purge.\\n\\nFile:Kurapaty 1989 meeting.jpg|The [Kuropaty](Kuropaty) mass grave site near [Minsk](Minsk), Belarus\\n\\nFile:КрасныйБор.jpg|The *Krasny Bor* memorial cemetery near [Petrozavodsk](Petrozavodsk), Russia\\n\\nFile:Stalin-repressions-poles-memorial.jpg|A memorial to [Polish](Poles in the Soviet Union) victims of Stalinist repression, [Tomsk](Tomsk), Russia\\n\\nFile:Кировский район Донецка 302.jpg|A monument to victims of political repressions in Rutchenkove settlement, part of [Donetsk](Donetsk), Ukraine\\n\\nFile:Stalin-repressions-Tomsk-stone.jpg|A memorial to victims of Stalinist repression in Tomsk, Russia\\n\\nFile:Сандормох25.jpg|The monumental slab at the entrance to the [Sandarmokh](Sandarmokh) burial grounds reads: \"People! do not kill one another\", Russia\\n\\n## Historical interpretations\\n\\nThe Great Purge has provoked numerous debates about its purpose, scale, and mechanisms. According to one interpretation, Stalin\\'s regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin\\'s paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [engineering](social)(Social engineering (political science)) campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).\\n\\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others. His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.\\n\\nSo what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn\\'t adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.\\n\\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians. One argues that the purges reflected Stalin\\'s ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin\\'s paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position. Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army. It was not a ploy—Stalin truly believed it. \"Stalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\"; thus \"Stalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign‐backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\" The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.Peter Whitewood, \\'\\'The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\\'s Purge of the Soviet Military* (2015) Quoting pp. 12, 276.Ronald Grigor Suny, review, *Historian* (2018) 80#1: 177–79.For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, *American Historical Review\\'\\' (2017) 122#5 pp. 1713–14.

Reese, \"Stalin Attacks the Red Army.\" *Military History Quarterly* 27.1 (2014): 38–45. [W. Thurston](Robert)(Robert W.

       "  'answer': 'The Great Purge, also known as the Great Terror, was a campaign of political repression and persecution orchestrated by Joseph Stalin between 1936 and 1938 in the Soviet Union. Sparked by Stalin’s desire to eliminate political rivals and consolidate his power, the Purge targeted a wide swath of society, including Communist Party members, government officials, military leaders, intelligentsia, peasants (especially so-called \"kulaks\"), and various national minorities. The NKVD, under leaders such as Genrikh Yagoda and Nikolai Yezhov, conducted mass arrests, show trials, forced confessions (often extracted by torture), executions, and deportations to labor camps (Gulags), resulting in an estimated 700,000 to 1.2 million deaths, with millions more imprisoned or exiled.\\n\\nA hallmark of the Purge was the series of highly publicized Moscow Trials, where former high-ranking Bolsheviks were accused of treason, espionage, and plots against Stalin, often based on forced confessions. The campaign extended into the Red Army, decimating its leadership and leaving the Soviet military weakened on the eve of World War II. The repression also targeted national minorities—especially Poles, Finns, Germans, and others—on the suspicion of being \"fifth columnists,\" leading to ethnic-based mass arrests and executions. The Purge had a chilling effect on Soviet society, instilling widespread fear, breaking up families, and eradicating much of the old revolutionary guard.\\n\\nAfter the Purge subsided in 1938, Stalin blamed excesses on the NKVD leadership, many of whom were themselves executed. The legacy of the Great Purge endured for decades, with many victims only posthumously rehabilitated during the Khrushchev Thaw and later under Gorbachev. The event remains a subject of historical debate, with interpretations ranging from viewing it as a product of Stalin’s paranoia to a response to genuine fears of internal and external threats. Today, the Great Purge is commemorated in Russia and former Soviet states with memorials and public acknowledgment of the massive loss of life and the profound impact on Soviet society.',\n",

Unwilling to rescue Fiona himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of performing the task on his behalf. When Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc, Farquaad announces that whoever kills the ogre will be crowned the victor; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad\\'s knights with relative ease. Amused, Farquaad proclaims them champions, and agrees to relocate the fairy-tale creatures if Shrek rescues Fiona.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by Dragon. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of [romanticism](romanticism); they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey. When Shrek removes his helmet and reveals he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her; Shrek carries her against her will. That night, after setting up camp and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek confides with Donkey about his frustration with being feared and rejected by others over his appearance. Fiona overhears this and decides to be kind to Shrek. The next day, the three are harassed by [Hood](Robin)(Robin Hood) and his band of Merry Men, with Fiona dispatching them easily using martial arts. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.\\n\\nWhen the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey later enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogre. She explains she has been cursed since childhood, forced to transform into an ogre every night, and changing back at sunrise. She tells Donkey that only \"true love\\'s kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love\\'s true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". Believing that she is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek\\'s abrupt hostility, Fiona accepts Farquaad\\'s marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall.\\n\\nShrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp. He quickly realizes that despite his privacy, he feels miserable and misses Fiona. Donkey returns to the swamp and confronts Shrek, explaining that the \"ugly beast\" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and urges him to express his feelings to Fiona before she marries. The two reconcile and quickly travel to Duloc by riding Dragon, who Donkey has befriended. Shrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony completes, and tells Fiona that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogre in front of everyone, causing Shrek to understand what he overheard. Outraged and disgusted, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. The two are saved when Dragon, alongside Donkey, break in and devour Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Though Fiona\\'s curse is broken, this permanently makes her an ogre against her expectations, though Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with fairy-tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.\\n\\n## Voice cast\\n\\n* [Myers](Mike)(Mike Myers) as:\\n\\n**[Shrek](Shrek (character))\\n\\n**One of the [Blind Mice](Three)(Three Blind Mice (Shrek))\\n\\n* [Murphy](Eddie)(Eddie Murphy) as [Donkey](Donkey (Shrek))\\n\\n* [Diaz](Cameron)(Cameron Diaz) as [Fiona](Princess)(Princess Fiona)\\n\\n* [Lithgow](John)(John Lithgow) as [Farquaad](Lord)(Lord Farquaad)\\n\\n* [Cassel](Vincent)(Vincent Cassel) as \"Monsieur\" Robin Hood\\n\\n* [Vernon](Conrad)(Conrad Vernon) as [Man](Gingerbread)(Gingerbread Man (Shrek))\\n\\n* [Miller](Chris)(Chris Miller (animator)) as:\\n\\n**Magic Mirror\\n\\n**Geppetto\\n\\n* [Cameron](Cody)(Cody Cameron) as:\\n\\n**[Pinocchio](Pinocchio (Shrek))\\n\\n**[Three Little Pigs](The)(The Three Little Pigs (Shrek))\\n\\n* [J.

Williams](John)(John H. Williams (film producer)) got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught [Katzenberg](Jeffrey)(Jeffrey Katzenberg)\\'s attention and the studio decided to make it into a film. Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: }}\\n\\nAfter buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active development in November 1995. [Spielberg](Steven)(Steven Spielberg) had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaptation of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where [Murray](Bill)(Bill Murray) would play Shrek and [Martin](Steve)(Steve Martin) would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director [Adamson](Andrew)(Andrew Adamson) refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him about how much the film should appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson\\'s ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and [N\\' Roses](Guns)(Guns N\\' Roses) music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and [Asbury](Kelly)(Kelly Asbury) joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film *[Stallion of the Cimarron](Spirit:)(Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron)*, and was replaced with story artist [Jenson](Vicky)(Vicky Jenson), although Asbury would later co-direct [sequel](the)(Shrek 2). Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know whom to go to with specific detail questions about the film\\'s sequences; \"We both ended up doing a lot of everything,\" Adamson said. \"We\\'re both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.\"\\n\\nSome early sketches of Shrek\\'s house were done between 1996 and 1997 using [Photoshop](Adobe Photoshop), with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. It was also thought one time that he lived with his parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom. Donkey was modeled after Pericles (born 1994; also known as Perry), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in [Alto, California](Palo)(Palo Alto, California). [Hui](Raman)(Raman Hui), supervising animator of *Shrek*, stated that Fiona \"wasn\\'t based on any real person\" and he did many different sketches for her. He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design. In early development, the art directors visited [Castle](Hearst)(Hearst Castle), [upon Avon](Stratford)(Stratford upon Avon), and [Dordogne](Dordogne) for inspiration. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in [South Carolina](Charleston,)(Charleston, South Carolina), for inspiration of Shrek\\'s swamp. Planned characters not used in the film include [Goldilocks](Goldilocks) and [Beauty](Sleeping)(Sleeping Beauty).\\n\\nDuring production, animators who failed while working on other projects, such as *[Prince of Egypt](The)(The Prince of Egypt)*, were often sent to work on *Shrek*. The reassignment was known as being \"Shreked\" and being sent to \"the [Gulag](Gulag)\".\\n\\n### Casting\\n\\n[Cage](Nicolas)(Nicolas Cage) was initially offered the role of Shrek but he turned it down because he did not want to look like an ogre. In 2013, Cage explained furthermore: \"When you\\'re drawn, in a way it says more about how children are going to see you than anything else, and I so care about that.\"\\n\\n[[File:Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|upright|[Myers](Mike)(Mike Myers) was re-cast as Shrek after [Farley](Chris)(Chris Farley)\\'s death.]]\\n\\n[Farley](Chris)(Chris Farley) was initially hired to voice Shrek, and he had recorded nearly all of the dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project. A story reel featuring a sample of Farley\\'s recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to [Myers](Mike)(Mike Myers), who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley\\'s version of Shrek. According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character \"for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [book is](the) a great story about accepting yourself for who you are.\"\\n\\nAfter Myers had completed providing the voice for the character over the course of 1999 and the film was well into production, a rough cut of the movie was shown to him in February 2000. Myers asked to re-record all of his lines with a [accent](Scottish)(Scottish English phonology), similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as *[I Married an Axe Murderer](So)(So I Married an Axe Murderer)* and *[Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me](Austin)(Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me)*. According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using a [of the Hill People](Lothar)(Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1988–89#Lothar of the Hill People) accent and a Canadian accent.Shrek. DVD Commentary, 2001. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, \"It was so good we took $4M worth of animation out and did it again.\" Myers disputed the cost, saying \"it didn\\'t cost the studio \\'millions of dollars\\',\" as rumored. \"What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.\" Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. \"I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character,\" Myers said. \"And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie.\"\\n\\nAnother person planned to voice a character in the film was [Garofalo](Janeane)(Janeane Garofalo), who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project for unexplained reasons. Years later, Garofalo stated \"I was never told why [was fired](I). I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don\\'t know why. Nobody told me&nbsp;... But, you know, the movie didn\\'t do anything, so who cares?\"\\n\\n### Animation\\n\\n*Shrek* was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters. A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997. The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating \"It looked terrible, it didn\\'t work, it wasn\\'t funny, and we didn\\'t like it.\" The studio then turned to its production partners at [Data Images](Pacific)(Pacific Data Images) (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998 and helped *Shrek* get to its final, computer-animated look. At this time, *[Antz](Antz)* was still in production at the studio and effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by [Warner](Aron)(Aron Warner) \"to start development for *Shrek*\". Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like the Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software on the market. This is particularly true with [Maya](Autodesk Maya), which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.\\n\\n\"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation,\" Hui noted. \"In *Antz*, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In *Shrek*, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right.\" One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey\\'s fur flow smoothly so that it did not look like that of a [Pet](Chia)(Chia Pet). This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators, who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it could be applied to many aspects of the movie, including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek\\'s tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey\\'s fur, requiring a separate rendering system and much attention from the [lighting](lighting) and [effects](visual)(visual effects) teams.\\n\\n*Shrek* has 31 sequences, with 1,288 total shots. Aron Warner said that the creators \"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\". Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature. In-film locations were finalized and, as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance. The animation was completed in 2000.\\n\\n### Music\\n\\n*Shrek* is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the [series](*Shrek*)(Shrek (franchise))) to have [Gregson-Williams](Harry)(Harry Gregson-Williams) team up with [Powell](John)(John Powell (composer)) to compose the score following *[Antz](Antz)* (1998) and *[Run](Chicken)(Chicken Run)* (2000). Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Gregson-Williams due to a conflict. The score was recorded at [Road Studios](Abbey)(Abbey Road Studios) by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering.\\n\\n*Shrek* introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used [music](pop)(pop music) and other [Oldies](Oldies) to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like \"[the Road Again](On)(On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song))\" and \"[a Little Tenderness](Try)(Try a Little Tenderness)\" were integrated in the film\\'s score. The band [Mouth](Smash)(Smash Mouth)\\'s song \"[Star](All)(All Star (song))\" gained massive popularity due to its usage in the film\\'s opening credits. As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film\\'s ending to \"go out with a big laugh\"; instead of ending the film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song \"[a Believer](I\\'m)(I\\'m a Believer)\" covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.\\n\\nAlthough [Wainwright](Rufus)(Rufus Wainwright)\\'s version of the song [\"Hallelujah\"](Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)) appeared in the soundtrack album, it was [Cale](John)(John Cale)\\'s version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of \"Hallelujah\" did not appear in the film due to the \"glass ceiling\" he was hitting because of his sexuality. An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale\\'s version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for [DreamWorks](DreamWorks Records) but Cale was not.\\n\\n## Cultural references\\n\\nIn many places the film references classic movies, predominantly those by [Disney](Walt Disney Animation Studios). When [Bell](Tinker)(Tinker Bell) falls on Donkey and he says \"I can fly\" and people around including the [Little Pigs](Three)(Three Little Pigs) say \"He can fly, he can fly\"; this is a reference to Disney\\'s *[Pan](Peter)(Peter Pan (1953 film))*. Another scene that references Disney media is one in which Donkey says, while flying, \"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain\\'t never seen a Donkey fly!\". This scene is a reference to the Disney film *[Dumbo](Dumbo)*. The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to *[White and the Seven Dwarfs](Snow)(Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film))*. The transformation scene at the end of the film references Disney\\'s *[and the Beast](Beauty)(Beauty and the Beast (1991 film))*.\\n\\nWhen Shrek crosses the bridge to the Castle and says, \"That\\'ll do, Donkey, that\\'ll do\", this is a reference to the movie *[Babe](Babe (film))*. The scene where Princess Fiona is fighting the [Men](Merry)(Merry Men) is a lengthy reference to the film *[Matrix](The)(The Matrix)*. At the end of the film, the Gingerbread Man at the end with a crutch (and one leg) says \"God bless us, everyone\" which is a reference to Tiny Tim in *[Christmas Carol](A)(A Christmas Carol)*.\\n\\nIn the scene where the Magic Mirror gives [Farquaad](Lord)(Lord Farquaad) the option to marry three princesses, it parodies popular American television show *[Dating Game](The)(The Dating Game)* featuring: [Cinderella](Cinderella) and [White](Snow)(Snow White). In addition, Lord Farquaad\\'s theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics [Disneyland](Disneyland), even in so far as parodying the famous \"[a Small World](It\\'s)(It\\'s a Small World)\" musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets. It has been suggested that Lord Farquaad himself is an unflattering parody of then-Disney CEO [Eisner](Michael)(Michael Eisner), whom producer Katzenberg reportedly dislikes.\\n\\n## Release\\n\\n### Marketing\\n\\nIn 2000, [IMAX](IMAX) released *[CyberWorld](CyberWorld)* onto its branded large-screen theaters. It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences, including the bar sequence in *[Antz](Antz)*. DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence\\'s \"stereoscopic translation\", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of *Shrek*. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending. Plans for this was dropped due to \"creative changes\" instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $1.18&nbsp;million, down from IMAX\\'s profit of $3.24&nbsp;million.\\n\\n[Disney](Radio)(Radio Disney) was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station, stating, \"Due to recent initiatives with [Walt Disney Company](The)(The Walt Disney Company), we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release *Shrek*. Stations may accept spot dollars only in individual markets.\" The restriction was later relaxed to allow ads for the film\\'s soundtrack album onto the network.\\n\\nOn May 7, 2001, [King](Burger)(Burger King) began promotions for the film, giving out a selection of nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the *Shrek* characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders. [cream](Ice)(Ice cream) chain [Baskin-Robbins](Baskin-Robbins) also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek\\'s Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of [Oreo](Oreo) Cookies \\'n Cream ice cream, [fudge](hot)(hot fudge), crushed chocolate cookies, [cream](whipped)(whipped cream) and squiggly [worms](gummy)(gummy worms), and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by [sunflowers](sunflowers). This was to support the film\\'s DVD/VHS release.[Baskin-Robbins in big Shrek\\'s promotion at thefreelibrary.com](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Baskin-Robbins+in+big+Shrek%27s+promotion.-a080598528) .\\n\\n### Home media\\n\\n*Shrek* was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on [VHS](VHS) and [DVD](DVD) on November 2, 2001. It surpassed *[Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace](Star)(Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace)*s record for becoming the fastest-selling DVD ever, selling 2.5 million copies within the first three days of release. Another 4.5 million copies were sold on VHS in the same timespan, making it the biggest opening weekend in retail video since *[Lion King](The)(The Lion King)* in 1995. Both releases included *[in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party](Shrek)(Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party)*, a 3-minute musical short film, that takes up right after *Shrek*s ending, with film\\'s characters performing a medley of modern pop songs.\\n\\nCoincidentally, the film was released on video the same day that Pixar\\'s *[Inc.](Monsters,)(Monsters, Inc.)* hit theaters. Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays, Disney\\'s executives did not receive this well, saying that the move \"seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film\\'s steam\". DreamWorks responded that it \"simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films.\" *Monsters, Inc.* earned that weekend more than $62&nbsp;million, breaking the record for an animated film, while *Shrek*s video release made more than $100&nbsp;million, and eventually became the biggest selling DVD at the time with over 5.5&nbsp;million sales. This broke the record previously held by *[Gladiator](Gladiator (2000 film))*, another DreamWorks film.  *Shrek* generated more than $420 million in revenue for DreamWorks on DVD and VHS, and has sold more than 21 million copies of the 23 million shipped by January 2002. Worldwide, more than 10 million *Shrek* DVDs have been sold by that point.\\n\\nA 3D version of the film was released on [3D](Blu-ray)(Blu-ray 3D) by [Home Entertainment](Paramount)(Paramount Home Entertainment) on December 1, 2010, along with its sequels, and a regular 2D [Blu-ray](Blu-ray) boxset of the series was released six days later.\\n\\nIn commemoration of the film\\'s 20th anniversary, an [HD Blu-ray](Ultra)(Ultra HD Blu-ray) edition was released on May 11, 2021, by [Pictures Home Entertainment](Universal)(Universal Pictures Home Entertainment).\\n\\n## Reception and legacy\\n\\n### Box office\\n\\n*Shrek* opened on around 6,000 screens across 3,587 theaters; eleven of them showed the film digitally. This was the first time that DreamWorks had shown one of its films digitally. The film earned $11.6&nbsp;million on its first day and $42.3&nbsp;million on its opening weekend, topping the box office for the weekend and averaging $11,805 from 3,587 theaters. In its [weekend](second)(Second weekend in box office performance#Second weekend increase), due to the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, the film gained 0.3&nbsp;percent to $42.5&nbsp;million and $55.2&nbsp;million over the four-day weekend, resulting in an overall 30&nbsp;percent gain. Despite this, the film finished in second place behind *[Harbor](Pearl)(Pearl Harbor (film))* and had an average of $15,240 from expanding to 3,623 sites. In its third weekend, the film retreated 34&nbsp;percent to $28.2&nbsp;million for a $7,695 average from expanding to 3,661 theaters. By mid-June 2001, *Shrek* became the top-grossing movie of the year domestically, defeating *[Mummy Returns](The)(The Mummy Returns)*.  The film closed on December 6, 2001, after grossing $267.7&nbsp;million domestically, along with $216.7&nbsp;million overseas, for a worldwide total of $484.4&nbsp;million. Produced on a $60&nbsp;million budget, the film was a huge box office smash and is the [highest-grossing film of 2001](fourth)(2001 in film#Highest-grossing films).\\n\\n*Shrek* became the highest-grossing animated film ever to be released in [Australia](Australia), passing the mark set by *[Lion King](The)(The Lion King)* in 1994. In the [Kingdom](United)(United Kingdom), *Shrek* regained the top spot at the British box office after being beaten out the previous week by *[Croft: Tomb Raider](Lara)(Lara Croft: Tomb Raider)*, earning a $20.3&nbsp;million since its opening in the UK.\\n\\n### Critical response\\n\\n*Shrek* has an approval rating of  based on  professional reviews on the [aggregator](review)(review aggregator) website [Tomatoes](Rotten)(Rotten Tomatoes), with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, \"While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent *Shrek* also manages to tweak Disney\\'s nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.\" |type=m |title=Shrek |access-date=}} [Metacritic](Metacritic) (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Shrek* a score of 84 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by [CinemaScore](CinemaScore) gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\\n\\n[[Murphy by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Eddie Murphy was particularly praised by reviewers for his performance and role as Donkey.](File:Eddie)]\\n\\n[Ebert](Roger)(Roger Ebert) praised the film, giving it four stars out of a possible four and describing it as \"jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart\". *[Today](USA)(USA Today)*s Susan Wloszczyna praised [Murphy](Eddie)(Eddie Murphy)\\'s performance, stating it \"gives the comic performance of his career, aided by sensational digital artistry, as he brays for the slightly neurotic motormouth\". [Schickel](Richard)(Richard Schickel) of *[Time](Time (magazine))* also enjoyed Murphy\\'s role, stating \"No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy.\" Peter Rainer of *[York](New)(New York (magazine))* magazine liked the script, also stating \"The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more \"human\" characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types.\" [Travers](Peter)(Peter Travers) of *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone)* wrote \"*Shrek* is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.\" James Berardinelli of *[ReelViews](ReelViews)* gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"*Shrek* is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.\" Kenneth Turan of the *[Angeles Times](Los)(Los Angeles Times)* wrote \"The witty, fractured fairy tale *Shrek* has a solid base of clever writing.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of *[Weekly](Entertainment)(Entertainment Weekly)* gave the film an A−, saying \"A kind of palace coup, a shout of defiance, and a coming of age for DreamWorks.\" Jay Boyar of the *[Sentinel](Orlando)(Orlando Sentinel)* wrote \"It\\'s a pleasure to be able to report that the movie both captures and expands upon the book\\'s playful spirit of deconstruction.\"\\n\\nSteven Rosen of *[Denver Post](The)(The Denver Post)* wrote \"DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name to trust for imaginative, funny animated movies that delight kids and adults equally.\" Susan Stark of *[Detroit News](The)(The Detroit News)* gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design.\" Jami Bernard of the *[York Daily News](New)(New York Daily News)* gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make *Shrek* an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication.\" Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass\". Elvis Mitchell of *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)* gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it\\'s just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of *Shrek*.\" [Steig](William)(William Steig), the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating \"We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, \\'What has Hollywood done to it?\\' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it.\"\\n\\nJohn Anderson of *[Newsday](Newsday)* wrote \"The kind of movie that will entertain everyone of every age and probably for ages to come.\" Jay Carr of *[Boston Globe](The)(The Boston Globe)* wrote \"In an era when much on film seems old, *Shrek* seems new and fresh and clever.\" Stephen Hunter of *[Washington Post](The)(The Washington Post)* gave the film five out of five stars, saying \"Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true.\" Joe Baltake of *[Sacramento Bee](The)(The Sacramento Bee)* wrote that it \"isn\\'t so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages\". Andrew Sarris of *[New York Observer](The)(The New York Observer)* wrote \"What gives *Shrek* its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies.\" Lisa Alspector of the *[Reader](Chicago)(Chicago Reader)* wrote \"This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take.\" Joe Morgenstern of *[Wall Street Journal](The)(The Wall Street Journal)* wrote \"The charms of *Shrek*, which is based on the children\\'s book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults.\" John Zebrowski of *[Seattle Times](The)(The Seattle Times)* gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes.

       "  'answer': \"*Shrek* is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy comedy film produced by DreamWorks and directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their feature debuts. Loosely adapted from William Steig's 1990 picture book, the film follows the anti-social ogre Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) whose swamp becomes overrun by fairy tale creatures exiled by the ruthless Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). To reclaim his home, Shrek strikes a deal to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) with the help of the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). The film is renowned for satirizing traditional fairy tales and Disney films, blending humor for both children and adults, and featuring groundbreaking animation.\\n\\nThe production of *Shrek* was notable for its technical innovation and creative challenges. Originally planned as a motion-capture hybrid, the project shifted to full computer animation by Pacific Data Images after unsatisfactory test results. The film's development included significant casting changes—most notably, Mike Myers replacing the late Chris Farley as Shrek and introducing a Scottish accent for the character. The animation team developed new methods for rendering realistic movement, fur, and environmental effects, while the soundtrack incorporated pop and rock songs to complement the irreverent tone. *Shrek*'s unique approach to parody, character design, and music helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a major competitor to Pixar.\\n\\nUpon its release, *Shrek* was a critical and commercial success, grossing nearly $492 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised its animation, voice performances (especially Murphy's Donkey), witty writing, and appeal across age groups. The film won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and received numerous other accolades, including BAFTAs and Annie Awards. Its influence shaped the direction of animated films in the 2000s, inspiring sequels, spin-offs, a Broadway musical, and enduring pop culture impact. In recognition of its significance, *Shrek* was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry in 2020.\",\n",

The [stele](Mesha)(Mesha stele), erected by king [Mesha](Mesha) of [Moab](Moab) in the 9th century BCE, may also refer to the \"House of David\", although this is disputed.

He becomes a favorite of [Saul](Saul), the first king of Israel, but is forced to go into hiding when Saul becomes paranoid that David is trying to take his throne.

He conquers [Jerusalem](Jerusalem), makes it the capital of a [Israel](united)(Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)) and brings the [of the Covenant](Ark)(Ark of the Covenant) to the city.

David\\'s son [Absalom](Absalom) later tries to overthrow him, but David returns to Jerusalem after Absalom\\'s death to continue his reign. David desires to build a temple to [Yahweh](Yahweh) but is denied because of the bloodshed in his reign. He dies at age 70 and chooses [Solomon](Solomon), his son with Bathsheba, as his successor instead of his eldest son [Adonijah](Adonijah).

Saul offered David his oldest daughter, [Merab](Merab), a marriage which David respectfully declined. Saul then gave Merab in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite.  Having been told that his younger daughter [Michal](Michal) was in love with David, Saul gave her in marriage to David upon David\\'s payment in [Philistine](Philistine) foreskins (ancient Jewish historian [Josephus](Josephus) lists the dowry as 100 Philistine heads). Saul became jealous of David and tried to have him killed. David escaped. Then Saul sent Michal to Galim to marry [son of Laish](Palti,)(Palti, son of Laish). David then took wives in [Hebron](Hebron), according to [Samuel](2)(2 Samuel) 3; they were [Ahinoam](Ahinoam) the Yizre\\'elite; [Abigail](Abigail), the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; [Maacah](Maacah), the daughter of Talmay, king of [Geshur](Geshur); [Haggith](Haggith); [Abital](Abital); and [Eglah](Eglah). Later, David wanted Michal back and [Abner](Abner), Ish-bosheth\\'s army commander, delivered her to David, causing her husband (Palti) great grief.\\n\\nThe [of Chronicles](Book)(Book of Chronicles) lists his sons with his various wives and [concubine](concubine)s.

[Jerimoth](Jerimoth), who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in 2 Chronicles 11:18. His daughter [Tamar](Tamar (2 Samuel)), by Maachah, is raped by her half-brother Amnon. David fails to bring Amnon to justice for his violation of Tamar, because he is his firstborn and he loves him, and so, Absalom (her full brother) murders Amnon to avenge Tamar.According to the Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version of 2 Samuel 13:21, \"... he did not punish his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn.\"   Despite the great sins they had committed, David showed grief at the deaths of his sons, weeping twice for Amnon [Samuel 13:31–26](2) and weeping seven times for Absalom.Soṭah, 10b\\n\\n### Narrative\\n\\n[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|left|thumb|[Samuel](Samuel (Bible)) [anoint](anoint)s David, [Europos](Dura)(Dura Europos), [Syria](Syria), 3rd century CE]]\\n\\n[God](Yahweh) is angered when [Saul](Saul), Israel\\'s king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice and later disobeys a divine command both to kill all of the [Amalek](Amalek)ites and to destroy their confiscated property.

Refusing the king\\'s offer of the royal armour, he kills Goliath with his [sling](Sling (weapon)). Saul inquires the name of the young hero\\'s father.\\n\\nSaul sets David over his army. All Israel loves David, but his popularity causes Saul to fear him (\"What else can he wish but the kingdom?\"). Saul plots his death, but Saul\\'s son [Jonathan](Jonathan (1 Samuel)), one of those who [David](loves)(David and Jonathan), warns him of his father\\'s schemes and David flees. He goes first to [Nob](Nob (Bible)), where he is fed by the priest [Ahimelech](Ahimelech) and given Goliath\\'s sword, and then to [Gath](Gath (city)), the Philistine city of Goliath, intending to seek refuge with King [Achish](Achish) there. Achish\\'s servants or officials question his loyalty, and David sees that he is in danger there. He goes next to the cave of [Adullam](Adullam), where his family joins him. From there he goes to seek refuge with the king of [Moab](Moab), but the prophet [Gad](Gad (prophet)) advises him to leave and he goes to the [of Hereth](Forest)(Forest of Hereth), and then to [Keilah](Keilah), where he is involved in a further battle with the Philistines. Saul plans to besiege Keilah so that he can capture David, so David leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants. From there he takes refuge in the mountainous [of Ziph](Wilderness)(Ziph (Judean Mountains)).\\n\\n[[File:Jusepe Leonardo 001.jpeg|thumb|Saul threatening David, by [Leonardo](José)(José Leonardo)]]\\n\\nJonathan meets with David again and confirms his loyalty to David as the future king. After the people of Ziph notify Saul that David is taking refuge in their territory, Saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture David in the Wilderness of Maon, but his attention is diverted by a renewed Philistine invasion and David is able to secure some respite at [Gedi](Ein)(Ein Gedi). Returning from battle with the Philistines, Saul heads to Ein Gedi in pursuit of David and enters the cave where, as it happens, David and his supporters are hiding, \"[attend to his needs](to)(defecation)\". David realises he has an [opportunity](Window of opportunity) to kill Saul, but this is not his intention: he secretly cuts off a corner of Saul\\'s robe, and when Saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to Saul as the king and to demonstrate, using the piece of robe, that he holds no malice towards Saul. The two are thus reconciled and Saul recognises David as his successor.\\n\\nA similar passage occurs in 1 Samuel 26, when David is able to infiltrate Saul\\'s camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep. In this account, David is advised by [Abishai](Abishai (biblical figure)) that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not \"stretch out [his] hand against the Lord\\'s anointed\". Saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue David and blesses him., NIV text\\n\\nIn 1 Samuel 27:1–4, Saul ceases to pursue David because David took refuge a second time cf.  with Achish, the Philistine king of Gath. Achish permits David to reside in [Ziklag](Ziklag), close to the border between Gath and Judea, from where he leads raids against the [Geshur](Geshur)ites, the Girzites and the [Amalek](Amalek)ites, but leads Achish to believe he is attacking the Israelites in Judah, the [Jerahmeelite](Jerahmeelite)s and the [Kenite](Kenite)s. Achish believes that David had become a loyal [vassal](vassal), but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of Gath, and at their request Achish instructs David to remain behind to guard the camp when the Philistines march against Saul. David returns to Ziklag and saves his wives and the citizens from the Amalekites. Jonathan and Saul are killed in battle, and David is anointed king over Judah. In the north, Saul\\'s son [Ish-Bosheth](Ish-Bosheth) is anointed king of Israel, and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered.\\n\\nWith the death of Saul\\'s son, the elders of Israel come to [Hebron](Hebron) and David is anointed king over all of Israel. He conquers [Jerusalem](Jerusalem), previously a [Jebusite](Jebusite) stronghold, and makes it his capital. He brings the [of the Covenant](Ark)(Ark of the Covenant) to the city, intending to build a temple for God, but the prophet [Nathan](Nathan (Prophet)) forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of David\\'s sons. Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David stating, \"your throne shall be established forever\". David wins additional victories over the Philistines, Moabites, [Edomites](Edomites), Amalekites, [Ammon](Ammon)ites and king [Hadadezer](Hadadezer ben Rehob) of [Aram-Zobah](Aram-Zobah), after which they become tributaries. His fame increase as a result, earning the praise of figures like king [Toi](Tou (biblical figure)) of [Hamath](Hamath), Hadadezer\\'s rival.\\n\\n[[File:Eugène Siberdt - The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David.jpg|thumb|*The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David*, oil on canvas by [Siberdt](Eugène)(Eugène Siberdt), 1866–1931 (Mayfair Gallery, London)]]\\n\\nDuring a siege of the Ammonite capital of [Rabbah](Rabbah), David remains in Jerusalem. He spies a woman, [Bathsheba](Bathsheba), bathing and summons her; she becomes pregnant. The text in the Bible does not explicitly state whether Bathsheba consented to sex.  David calls her husband, [the Hittite](Uriah)(Uriah the Hittite), back from the battle to rest, hoping that he will go home to his wife and the child will be presumed to be his. Uriah does not visit his wife, however, so David conspires to have him killed in the heat of battle. David then marries the widowed Bathsheba. In response, Nathan, after trapping the king in his guilt with a parable that actually described his sin in analogy, prophesies the punishment that will fall upon him, stating \"the sword shall never depart from your house.\" Others say it included his posterity.;  }} When David acknowledges that he has [sin](sin)ned, Nathan advises him that his sin is forgiven and he will not die,Adultery was a capital crime under [law](Mosaic)(Mosaic law):  but the child will.: NIV translation\\n\\nIn fulfillment of Nathan\\'s words, the child born of the union between David and Bathsheba dies, and another of David\\'s sons, [Absalom](Absalom), fueled by vengeance and lust for power, rebels. Thanks to [Hushai](Hushai), a friend of David who was ordered to infiltrate Absalom\\'s court to successfully sabotage his plans, Absalom\\'s forces are routed at the battle of the [of Ephraim](Wood)(Wood of Ephraim), and he is caught by his long hair in the branches of a tree where, contrary to David\\'s order, he is killed by [Joab](Joab), the commander of David\\'s army. David laments the death of his favourite son: \"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" until Joab persuades him to recover from \"the extravagance of his grief\" and to fulfill his duty to his people. David returns to [Gilgal](Gilgal) and is escorted across the [Jordan](River)(River Jordan) and back to Jerusalem by the tribes of [Judah](Tribe of Judah) and [Benjamin](Tribe of Benjamin).\\n\\nWhen David is old and bedridden, [Adonijah](Adonijah), his eldest surviving son and natural heir, declares himself king. Bathsheba and Nathan go to David and obtain his agreement to crown Bathsheba\\'s son [Solomon](Solomon) as king, according to David\\'s earlier promise, and the revolt of Adonijah is put down. David dies at the age of 70 after reigning for 40 years, and on his deathbed counsels Solomon to walk in the ways of God and to take revenge on his enemies.\\n\\n### Psalms\\n\\n[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol1v.jpg|thumb|David Composing the Psalms, [Psalter](Paris)(Paris Psalter), 10th century]]\\n\\nThe [of Samuel](Book)(Book of Samuel) calls David a skillful harp (lyre) player and \"the sweet psalmist of Israel.\"}} Yet, while almost half of the [Psalms](Psalms) are headed \"A Psalm of David\" (also translated as \"to David\" or \"for David\") and tradition identifies several with specific events in David\\'s life (e.g., [3](Psalms)(Psalm 3), [7](Psalm 7), [18](Psalm 18), [34](Psalm 34), [51](Psalm 51), [52](Psalm 52), [54](Psalm 54), [56](Psalm 56), [57](Psalm 57), [59](Psalm 59), [60](Psalm 60), [63](Psalm 63) and [142](Psalm 142)),Commentary on II Samuel 22, The Anchor Bible, Vol. 9. *II Samuel*.

Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House  According to the parallel narrative in 1 Samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him, Abimelech allows David to leave, exclaiming, \"Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?\"\\n\\n## Interpretation in Abrahamic tradition\\n\\n### Rabbinic Judaism\\n\\nDavid is an important figure in [Judaism](Rabbinic)(Rabbinic Judaism), with many legends around him. According to one tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father\\'s sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school.\\n\\nDavid\\'s adultery with Bathsheba is interpreted as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to [Talmudic](Talmudic) sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the King. However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.  God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.\\n\\nIn [legend](Jewish)(Legends of the Jews), David\\'s sin with Bathsheba is the punishment for David\\'s excessive self-consciousness who had besought God to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his constancy as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (who successfully passed the test) whose names later were united with God\\'s, while David eventually failed through the temptation of a woman.\\n\\nAccording to [midrashim](midrashim), [Adam](Adam) gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.Zohar Bereishis 91b Also, according to the [Yerushalmi](Talmud)(Talmud Yerushalmi), David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of [Shavuot](Shavuot) (Feast of Weeks).

Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment (\"the anointed one\", as the title [Messiah](Messiah) had it), in the last two centuries BCE the \"son of David\" became the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus \"by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man\".[\"David\"](https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David)  article from *Encyclopædia Britannica Online*\\n\\nThe early Church believed that \"the life of David [foreshadowed](foreshadowing) the life of Christ; [Bethlehem](Bethlehem) is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, [Good Shepherd](the)(The Good Shepherd (Christianity)); the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are [typical](Typology (theology)) of the [wounds](five)(Holy Wounds); the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, [Ahitophel](Ahitophel), and the passage over the [Cedron](Kidron Valley) remind us of Christ\\'s [Passion](Sacred)(Passion (Christianity)). Many of the Davidic Psalms, as we learn from the New Testament, are clearly [typical](Typology (theology)) of the future [Messiah](Messiah).\"John Corbett (1911) [King David](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04642b.htm)  *[Catholic Encyclopedia](The)(The Catholic Encyclopedia)* (New York: Robert Appleton Company) In the [Ages](Middle)(Middle Ages), \"[Charlemagne](Charlemagne) thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a \\'new David\\'.

His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.\\n\\nDavid was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of [monarchy](divinely-ordained)(Divine right of kings) throughout medieval [Europe](Western)(Western Europe) and [Eastern](Eastern Europe) [Christendom](Christendom). David was perceived as the biblical predecessor to Christian Roman and Byzantine emperors and the name \"New David\" was used as an honorific reference to these rulers. The [Georgian](Kingdom of Georgia) [Bagratids](Bagrationi) and the [dynasty](Solomonic)(Solomonic dynasty) of [Ethiopia](Empire of Ethiopia) claimed a direct [descent](biological)(Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty) from him. Likewise, kings of the [Frankish](Franks) [dynasty](Carolingian)(Carolingian dynasty) frequently connected themselves to David; [Charlemagne](Charlemagne) himself occasionally used the name of David as his pseudonym.\\n\\n### Islam\\n\\nDavid (Arabic: داوود \\'\\'Dā\\'ūd* or *Dāwūd*) is an important figure in [Islam](Islam) as one of the major [prophet](prophet)s sent by [God](God) to guide the [Israelites](Israelites). David is mentioned several times in the [Quran](Quran) with the [Arabic](Arabic language) name داود, *Dāwūd* or *Dā\\'ūd\\'\\', often with his son [Solomon](Solomon in Islam). In the Quran David killed [Goliath](Goliath#Islam) ([Q2:251](Q2:251)), a giant soldier in the Philistine army. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it ([Q38:20](Q38:20)). David was made God\\'s \"[vicegerent](vicegerent) on earth\" ([Q38:26](Q38:26)) and God further gave David sound judgment ([Q21:78](Q21:78); [Q37:21–24](Q37:21–24), [Q26](Q26)) as well as the [Psalms](Psalms), regarded as books of divine wisdom ([Q4:163](Q4:163); [Q17:55](Q17:55)). The birds and mountains united with David in uttering praise to God ([Q21:79](Q21:79); [Q34:10](Q34:10); [Q38:18](Q38:18)), while God made iron soft for David ([Q34:10](Q34:10)), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning [mail](chain)(chain mail) out of iron ([Q21:80](Q21:80)); this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his [bronze](bronze) and [iron](cast)(cast iron)-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields ([Q21:78](Q21:78)) and David judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber ([Q38:21–23](Q38:21–23)). Since there is no mention in the Quran of the wrong David did to [Uriah](Uriah the Hittite) nor any reference to [Bathsheba](Bathsheba), [Muslim](Muslim)s reject this narrative.Wheeler, Brannon M. *The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism*, \"David\"\\n\\nMuslim [tradition](tradition) and the *[hadith](hadith)* stress David\\'s zeal in daily prayer as well as in [fasting](fasting).\"Dawud\". *Encyclopedia of Islam* Quran commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous *[of the Prophets](Stories)(Stories of the Prophets)* elaborate upon David\\'s concise quranic narratives and specifically mention David\\'s gift in singing his Psalms as well as his beautiful recitation and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.*Stories of the Prophets*, Ibn Kathir, \"Story of David\"\\n\\n## Historicity\\n\\n### Literary analysis\\n\\n[[file:David SM Maggiore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Statue of King David (1609–1612) by [Cordier](Nicolas)(Nicolas Cordier) in the Borghese Chapel of the [di Santa Maria Maggiore](Basilica)(Santa Maria Maggiore) in [Rome](Rome), Italy]]\\n\\nBiblical literature and archaeological finds are the only sources that attest to David\\'s life. Some scholars have concluded that this was likely compiled from contemporary records of the 11th and 10th centuries BCE, but that there is no clear historical basis for determining the exact date of compilation. Other scholars believe that the [of Samuel](Books)(Books of Samuel) were substantially composed during the time of King [Josiah](Josiah) at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the [exile](Babylonian)(Babylonian exile) (6th century BCE), and substantially complete by about 550 BCE. Old Testament scholar [Auld](Graeme)(Graeme Auld) contends that further editing was done even after then—the silver quarter-shekel which Saul\\'s servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 \"almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period\" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times. The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the \"history of David\\'s rise\" and the \"succession narrative\". and  The [of Chronicles](Book)(Books of Chronicles), which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350–300 BCE, and uses Samuel and Kings as its source.\\n\\nBiblical evidence indicates that David\\'s Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him *negid*, meaning \"prince\" or \"chief\", rather than *melek*, meaning \"king\"; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs (even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around [Hebron](Hebron).\\n\\nBeyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. A number of scholars consider the David story to be a heroic tale similar to [Arthur](King)(King Arthur)\\'s legend or [Homer](Homer)\\'s epics,*;  whereas others think that such comparisons are questionable.Kalimi, Isaac. *Writing and Rewriting the Story of Solomon in Ancient Israel*, Cambridge University Press, 2019, p. 53 One theme that has been paralleled with other Near Eastern literature is the homoerotic nature of the relationship between [and Jonathan](David)(David and Jonathan). The instance in the [of Jashar](Book)(Book of Jashar), excerpted in [2](Samuel)(Samuel 2) (1:26), where David \"proclaims that Jonathan\\'s love was sweeter to him than the love of a woman\", has been compared to [Achilles](Achilles)\\' comparison of [Patroclus](Patroclus) to a girl and [Gilgamesh](Gilgamesh)\\'s love for [Enkidu](Enkidu) \"as a woman\". Others hold that the David story is a political apology—an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide. The authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David\\'s reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.\\n\\nSome other studies of David have been written: [Halpern](Baruch)(Baruch Halpern) has pictured David as a brutal tyrant, a murderer and a lifelong vassal of [Achish](Achish), the Philistine king of Gath; Steven McKenzie argues that David came from a wealthy family, was \"ambitious and ruthless\" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons. Joel S. Baden has described him as \"an ambitious, ruthless, flesh-and-blood man who achieved power by any means necessary, including murder, theft, bribery, sex, deceit, and treason. [G. Dever](William)(William G. Dever) described him as \"a serial killer\".\\n\\n[L. Wright](Jacob)(Jacob L. Wright) has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods.\\n\\nIsaac Kalimi wrote about the tenth century BCE that: \"Almost all that one can say about King Solomon and his time is unavoidably based on the biblical texts. Nevertheless, here also one cannot always offer conclusive proof that a certain biblical passage reflects the actual historical situation in the tenth century BCE, beyond arguing that it is plausible to this or that degree.\"\\n\\n### Archaeological findings\\n\\n[[File:JRSLM 300116 Tel Dan Stele 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [Dan Stele](Tel)(Tel Dan Stele)]]\\n\\nThe [Dan Stele](Tel)(Tel Dan Stele), discovered in 1993, is an inscribed stone erected by [Hazael](Hazael), a [of Damascus](king)(Aram-Damascus) in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE. It commemorates the king\\'s victory over two enemy kings, and contains the phrase , , which most scholars translate as \"House of David\". Other scholars have challenged this reading, but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the [of Judah](Kingdom)(Kingdom of Judah) which traced its ancestry to a founder named David.\\n\\nTwo [epigrapher](epigrapher)s, [Lemaire](André)(André Lemaire) and [Puech](Émile)(Émile Puech), hypothesised in 1994 that the [Stele](Mesha)(Mesha Stele) from [Moab](Moab), dating from the 9th century, also contain the words \"House of David\" at the end of Line 31, although this was considered as less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription. In May 2019, [Finkelstein](Israel)(Israel Finkelstein), [Na\\'aman](Nadav)(Nadav Na\\'aman), and [Römer](Thomas)(Thomas Römer) concluded from the new images that the ruler\\'s name contained three consonants and started with a [*bet*](bet (letter)), which excludes the reading \"House of David\" and, in conjunction with the monarch\\'s city of residence \"Horonaim\" in Moab, makes it likely that the one mentioned is King [Balak](Balak), a name also known from the [Bible](Hebrew)(Hebrew Bible). Later that year, Michael Langlois used high-resolution photographs of both the inscription itself, and the 19th-century original [squeeze](Squeeze paper) of the then still intact stele to reaffirm Lemaire\\'s view that line 31 contains the phrase \"House of David\". Replying to Langlois, Na\\'aman argued that the \"House of David\" reading is unacceptable because the resulting sentence structure is extremely rare in West Semitic royal inscriptions.\\n\\n[[File:Karnak Tempel 19.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Triumphal Relief of [I](Shoshenq)(Shoshenq I) near the [Portal](Bubastite)(Bubastite Portal) at [Karnak](Karnak), depicting the god [Amun-Re](Amun-Re) receiving a list of cities and villages conquered by the king in his Near Eastern military campaigns.]]\\n\\nBesides the two steles, Bible scholar and Egyptologist [Kitchen](Kenneth)(Kenneth Kitchen) suggests that David\\'s name also appears in a relief of Pharaoh [Shoshenq](Shoshenq I), who is usually identified with [Shishak](Shishak) in the Bible. The relief claims that Shoshenq raided places in [Palestine](Palestine (region)) in 925 BCE, and Kitchen interprets one place as \"Heights of David\", which was in Southern Judah and the [Negev](Negev) where the Bible says David took refuge from Saul. The relief is damaged and interpretation is uncertain.\\n\\n### Archaeological analysis\\n\\nOf the evidence in question, John Haralson Hayes and James Maxwell Miller wrote in 2006: \"If one is not convinced in advance by the biblical profile, then there is nothing in the archaeological evidence itself to suggest that much of consequence was going on in Palestine during the tenth century BCE, and certainly nothing to suggest that Jerusalem was a great political and cultural center.\"A History of Ancient Israel and Judah; ByJames Maxwell Miller & John Haralson Hayes; pages 204; SCM Press, 2006;  This echoed the 1995 conclusion of [Kuhrt](Amélie)(Amélie Kuhrt), who noted that \"there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the united monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether), and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon,\" while noting, \"against this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites, which is plausibly related to the tenth century.\"\\n\\nIn 2007, [Finkelstein](Israel)(Israel Finkelstein) and [Asher Silberman](Neil)(Neil Asher Silberman) stated that the archaeological evidence shows that Judah was sparsely inhabited and Jerusalem no more than a small village. The evidence suggested that David ruled only as a chieftain over an area which cannot be described as a state or as a kingdom, but more as a chiefdom, much smaller and always overshadowed by the older and more powerful [of Israel](kingdom)(Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)) to the north.;  They posited that Israel and Judah were not [monotheistic](Monotheism) at the time and that later seventh-century redactors sought to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs. They noted a lack of archeological evidence for David\\'s military campaigns and a relative underdevelopment of Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, compared to a more developed and urbanized Samaria, capital of Israel during the 9th century BCE.. \"We still have no hard archaeological evidence—despite the unparalleled biblical description of its grandeur—that Jerusalem was anything more than a modest highland village in the time of David, Solomon, and Rehoboam.\". Speaking of Samaria: \"The scale of this project was enormous.\"\\n\\nIn 2014, [Mazar](Amihai)(Amihai Mazar) wrote that the [Monarchy](United)(United Monarchy) of the 10th century BCE can be described as a \"state in development\". He compared David to [Labaya](Labaya), a Caananite warlord living during the time of Pharaoh [Akhenaten](Akhenaten). While Mazar believes that David reigned over Israel during the 11th century BCE, he argues that much of the Biblical text is of \"literary-legendary nature\". According to William G.

According to Mazar, this would prove that an organized state did exist in the 10th century. In 2006, [Kitchen](Kenneth)(Kenneth Kitchen) came to a similar conclusion, arguing that \"the physical archaeology of tenth-century [Canaan](Canaan) is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain.\"\\n\\nScholars such as [Finkelstein](Israel)(Israel Finkelstein), Lily Singer-Avitz, [Herzog](Ze\\'ev)(Ze\\'ev Herzog) and [Ussishkin](David)(David Ussishkin) do not accept these conclusions.Has King David\\'s Palace in Jerusalem been Found? By Israel Finkelstein, Lily Singer-Avitz, Ze\\'ev Herzog & David Ussishkin; Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, Volume 34, 2007 - Issue 2; Pages 142-164 Finkelstein does not accept the dating of these structures to the 10th century BCE, based in part on the fact that later structures on the site penetrated deep into underlying layers, that the entire area had been excavated in the early 20th century and then backfilled, that pottery from later periods was found below earlier strata, and that consequently the finds collected by E. Mazar cannot necessarily be considered as retrieved in situ.The \"Large Stone Structure\" in Jerusalem Reality versus Yearning By Israel Finkelstein, 2011; Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palastina-Vereins 127(1):2-10; at [https://www.mq.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/527790/Finkelstein-2011,-Jerusalem.pdf] [Maeir](Aren)(Aren Maeir) said in 2010 that he has seen no evidence that these structures are from the 10th century BCE and that proof of the existence of a strong, centralized kingdom at that time remains \"tenuous.\"\\'Jerusalem city wall dates back to King Solomon\\'; by Abe Selig; Jerusalem Post, 23 February 2010; at [https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Jlem-city-wall-dates-back-to-King-Solomon]\\n\\nExcavations at [Qeiyafa](Khirbet)(Khirbet Qeiyafa) by archaeologists [Garfinkel](Yosef)(Yosef Garfinkel) and [Ganor](Saar)(Saar Ganor) found an urbanized settlement [dated](radiocarbon)(radiocarbon dated) dating to the 10th century, which supports the existence of an urbanised kingdom. Following such discovery, the [Antiquities Authority](Israel)(Israel Antiquities Authority) stated: \"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\" However, the techniques and interpretations to reach some conclusions related to Khirbet Qeiyafa have been criticized by other scholars, such as Israel Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin of [Aviv University](Tel)(Tel Aviv University), who have, instead, proposed that the city is to be identified as part of a northern Israelite polity.\\n\\nIn 2018, [Faust](Avraham)(Avraham Faust) and Yair Sapir stated that [Canaanite site](a)(Eglon, Canaan) at Tel Eton, about thirty miles from Jerusalem, was taken over by a Judahite community by peaceful assimilation and transformed from a village into a central town at some point in the late 11th or early 10th century BCE.

In the novel, [Elhanan](Elhanan son of Jair) in fact killed Goliath but David claimed the credit; and [Joab](Joab), David\\'s cousin and general, took it upon himself to make many of the difficult decisions of war and statecraft when David vacillated or wrote poetry instead.\\n\\n***1936** [Faulkner](William)(William Faulkner)\\'s *[Absalom!](Absalom,)(Absalom, Absalom!)* refers to the story of Absalom, David\\'s son; his rebellion against his father and his death at the hands of David\\'s general, Joab.

       "  'answer': 'David is a central figure in the Hebrew Bible and is traditionally regarded as the third king of the united Kingdom of Israel and Judah, succeeding Ish-bosheth and preceding his son Solomon. According to biblical accounts, David began as a young shepherd from Bethlehem, the youngest son of Jesse, and rose to prominence after famously defeating the Philistine giant Goliath. He entered the service of King Saul, survived multiple attempts on his life, and eventually became king after Saul\\'s death. As ruler, David unified the Israelite tribes, established Jerusalem as his capital, brought the Ark of the Covenant there, and expanded his kingdom through numerous military campaigns. Despite his achievements, his reign was marked by personal and political turmoil, including his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and the subsequent rebellion of his son Absalom. David died at the age of 70, having reigned for 40 years, and chose Solomon as his successor.\\n\\nDavid\\'s legacy has had a profound impact on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Jewish tradition, David is revered as the ideal king and the ancestor of the Messiah, and many psalms are attributed to him. Rabbinic literature explores his virtues and flaws, often emphasizing his repentance after moral failures. In Christianity, David is seen as a precursor and ancestor of Jesus, with his life and psalms interpreted as foreshadowing Christ’s mission and suffering. The New Testament refers to Jesus as the \"Son of David,\" and Christian liturgy and art frequently reference Davidic themes. In Islam, David (Dawud) is recognized as a prophet and king, celebrated for his wisdom, justice, and psalmody, though Islamic tradition does not include the story of Bathsheba.\\n\\nThe historicity of David has been a subject of scholarly debate. While the biblical narrative provides a rich and detailed account of his life, archaeological evidence remains limited and often contested. The Tel Dan Stele, which mentions the \"House of David,\" is considered by many scholars as the earliest extrabiblical reference to David, though its interpretation is debated. Some archaeologists argue that Jerusalem during David’s time was a modest settlement rather than a grand capital, while others point to findings such as the Large Stone Structure as possible evidence of a centralized kingdom. Regardless of historical uncertainties, David\\'s story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and music, and he remains a symbol of leadership, faith, and complex humanity in Western and Middle Eastern cultures.',\n",

Originally designed by [Google](Google), the project is  now maintained by the [Native Computing Foundation](Cloud)(Cloud Native Computing Foundation).\\n\\nThe name *Kubernetes* originates from [Greek](Greek language), meaning \\'helmsman\\' or \\'pilot\\'. *Kubernetes* is often abbreviated as *K8s*, counting the eight letters between the *K* and the *s* (a [numeronym](numeronym)).\\n\\nKubernetes works with [containerd](containerd) and [CRI-O](Cloud Native Computing Foundation#CRI-O).  Its suitability for running and managing large cloud-native workloads has led to widespread adoption of it in the data center. There are multiple distributions of this platform – from [ISVs](Independent Software Vendor) as well as hosted-on cloud offerings from all the major public cloud vendors.\\n\\n## History\\n\\n[[Kubernetes Engine talk at Google Cloud Summit](File:GoogleCloudKubernetes.jpg|thumb|Google)]\\n\\nKubernetes ([κυβερνήτης](wikt:κυβερνήτης) *kubernḗtēs*, Greek for \"steersman, navigator\" or \"guide\", and the etymological root of [cybernetics](cybernetics)) was announced by Google in mid-2014. The project was created by Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie, who were soon joined by other Google engineers, including Brian Grant and Tim Hockin.\\n\\nThe design and development of Kubernetes was influenced by Google\\'s [Borg](Borg (cluster manager)) cluster manager. Many of its top contributors had previously worked on Borg; they codenamed Kubernetes \"\" after the *Star Trek* ex-[Borg](Borg) character [of Nine](Seven)(Seven of Nine) and gave its logo a seven-spoked wheel. Unlike Borg, which was written in [C++](C++), Kubernetes source code is in the [Go](Go (programming language)) language.\\n\\nKubernetes 1.0 was released on July 21, 2015. Google worked with the [Foundation](Linux)(Linux Foundation) to form the [Native Computing Foundation](Cloud)(Cloud Native Computing Foundation) (CNCF) and offered Kubernetes as a seed technology. In February 2016, the Helm package manager for Kubernetes was released.\\n\\nGoogle was already offering managed Kubernetes services, while [Hat](Red)(Red Hat) was supporting Kubernetes as part of [OpenShift](OpenShift) since the inception of the Kubernetes project in 2014. In 2017, the principal competitors rallied around Kubernetes and announced adding native support for it:\\n\\n* [VMWare](VMWare) (proponent of [Cloud Foundry](Pivotal)(Pivotal Cloud Foundry)) in August,\\n\\n* [Inc.](Mesosphere,)(Mesosphere, Inc.)

(proponent of [Docker](Docker (software)#Tools)) in October,\\n\\n* [Azure](Microsoft)(Microsoft Azure) also in October,\\n\\n* [AWS](Amazon Web Services) announced support for Kubernetes via the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in November.\\n\\nOn March 6, 2018, Kubernetes Project reached ninth place in the list of [GitHub](GitHub) projects by the number of [commits](Commit (version control)), and second place in authors and issues, after the [kernel](Linux)(Linux kernel).\\n\\nUntil version 1.18, Kubernetes followed an N-2 support policy, meaning that the three most recent minor versions receive security updates and bug fixes. Starting with version 1.19, Kubernetes follows an N-3 support policy.\\n\\nOriginally, it interfaced exclusively with the [Docker](Docker (software)) runtime through a \"Dockershim\"; however, from November 2020 up to April 2022, Kubernetes has deprecated the [shim](Shim (computing)) in favor of directly interfacing with the container through Containerd, or replacing Docker with a runtime that is compliant with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). With the release of v1.24 in May 2022, \"Dockershim\" has been removed entirely.\\n\\n## Concepts\\n\\n[[architecture diagram](File:kubernetes.png|thumb|Kubernetes)]\\n\\nKubernetes defines a set of building blocks (\"primitives\") that collectively provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain, and scale applications based on CPU, memory or custom metrics. Kubernetes is [coupled](loosely)(Loose coupling) and extensible to meet different workloads. The internal components as well as extensions and containers that run on Kubernetes rely on the Kubernetes API. The platform exerts its control over compute and storage resources by defining resources as Objects, which can then be managed as such.\\n\\nKubernetes follows the [architecture](primary/replica)(primary/replica architecture). The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual [node](Node (networking)) and those that are part of the control plane.\\n\\n### Control plane\\n\\nThe Kubernetes master node handles the Kubernetes control plane of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting [cluster](high-availability)(high-availability cluster)s. The various components of the Kubernetes control plane are as follows:\\n\\n* **[etcd](etcd)**[Linux by CoreOS: Cluster infrastructure](Container)(Container Linux by CoreOS#Cluster infrastructure) is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, [data store](key-value)(key-value data store) that [CoreOS](CoreOS) has developed. It reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. etcd favors consistency over availability in the event of a network partition (see [theorem](CAP)(CAP theorem)). The consistency is crucial for correctly scheduling and operating services.\\n\\n* The **API server** serves the Kubernetes [API](Application programming interface) using [JSON](JSON) over [HTTP](Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes. The API server processes and validates [REST](Representational state transfer) requests and updates the state of the [API](Application programming interface) objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across worker nodes. The API server uses etcd\\'s watch API to monitor the cluster, roll out critical configuration changes, or restore any divergences of the state of the cluster back to what the deployer declared. As an example, the deployer may specify that three instances of a particular \"pod\" (see below) need to be running. etcd stores this fact. If the Deployment Controller finds that only two instances are running (conflicting with the etcd declaration), it schedules the creation of an additional instance of that pod.\\n\\n* The **scheduler** is the extensible component that selects on which node an unscheduled pod (the basic entity managed by the scheduler) runs, based on resource availability. The scheduler tracks resource use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. For this purpose, the scheduler must know the resource requirements, resource availability, and other user-provided constraints or policy directives such as quality-of-service, affinity vs. anti-affinity requirements, and data locality.  The scheduler\\'s role is to match resource \"supply\" to workload \"demand\".\\n\\n* A **controller** is a reconciliation loop that drives the actual cluster state toward the desired state, communicating with the API server to create, update, and delete the resources it manages (e.g., pods or service endpoints). One kind of controller is a Replication Controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails. Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a DaemonSet Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion (e.g., as part of a batch job). Labels selectors that are part of the controller\\'s definition specify the set of pods that a controller manages.\\n\\n*The **controller manager** is a process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers.\\n\\n### Nodes\\n\\nA node, also known as a worker or a minion, is a machine where containers (workloads) are deployed. Every node in the cluster must run a container [runtime](Runtime system) such as [containerd](containerd), as well as the below-mentioned components, for communication with the primary for network configuration of these containers.\\n\\n* **Kubelet** is responsible for the running state of each node, ensuring that all containers on the node are healthy. It takes care of starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers organized into pods as directed by the control plane. Kubelet monitors the state of a pod, and if not in the desired state, the pod re-deploys to the same node. Node status is relayed every few seconds via heartbeat messages to the primary. Once the primary detects a node failure, the Replication Controller observes this state change and launches pods on other healthy nodes. Issues and Best Practices  Snyk|url=https://snyk.io/learn/kubernetes-security/|access-date=2021-05-16|website=snyk.io|date=26 July 2020|language=en-US}}\\n\\n***Kube-proxy** is an implementation of a [proxy](network)(Proxy server) and a [balancer](load)(Load balancing (computing)), and it supports the service abstraction along with other networking operation. It is responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate container based on IP and port number of the incoming request.\\n\\n* A **container** resides inside a pod. The container is the lowest level of a micro-service, which holds the running application, libraries, and their dependencies. Containers can be exposed to the world through an external IP address. Kubernetes has supported Docker containers since its first version. In July 2016 the [rkt](rkt (software)) container engine was added.\\n\\n### Namespaces\\n\\nIn Kubernetes, namespaces are utilized to segregate the resources it handles into distinct and non-intersecting collections. They are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects, or even separating environments like development, test, and production.\\n\\n### Pods\\n\\nThe basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which consists of one or more containers that are guaranteed to be co-located on the same node. Each pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster, allowing applications to use ports without the risk of conflict. Within the pod, all containers can reference each other.\\n\\nA volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, can be defined within a pod and made accessible to the containers residing in it. Pods can be managed manually through the Kubernetes API, or their management can be delegated to a controller. Such volumes are also the basis for the Kubernetes features of ConfigMaps (to provide access to configuration through the file system visible to the container) and Secrets (to provide access to credentials needed to access remote resources securely, by providing those credentials on the file system visible only to authorized containers).\\n\\n#### DaemonSets\\n\\nTypically, the task of determining the node on which a pod should run is delegated to the Kubernetes Scheduler. However, in certain scenarios, it may be necessary to deploy a pod on every node in the cluster, which is particularly helpful for use cases involving log collection, ingress controllers, and storage services. This specific type of pod scheduling can be achieved by utilizing DaemonSets.\\n\\n#### ReplicaSets\\n\\nA ReplicaSet\\'s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.\\n\\nThe ReplicaSets can also be said to be a grouping mechanism that lets Kubernetes maintain the number of instances that have been declared for a given pod. The definition of a ReplicaSet uses a selector, whose evaluation will result in identifying all pods that are associated with it.\\n\\n### Services\\n\\n[[view showing how Services interact with Pod networking in a Kubernetes cluster](File:Pod-networking.png|thumb|Simplified)]\\n\\nA Kubernetes service is a set of pods that work together, such as one tier of a [multi-tier](Multitier architecture) application. The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector. Kubernetes provides two modes of [discovery](service)(service discovery), using environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS. Service discovery assigns a stable IP address and [name](DNS)(DNS name) to the service, and load balances traffic in a [round-robin](Round-robin DNS) manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector (even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine). By default a service is exposed inside a cluster (e.g., [end](back)(Front and back ends) pods might be grouped into a service, with requests from the front-end pods load-balanced among them), but a service can also be exposed outside a cluster (e.g., for clients to reach front-end pods).\\n\\n### Volumes\\n\\nFile systems in the Kubernetes container provide [storage](ephemeral)(ephemeral storage), by default. This means that a restart of the pod will wipe out any data on such containers, and therefore, this form of storage is quite limiting in anything but trivial applications. A Kubernetes Volume provides persistent storage that exists for the lifetime of the pod itself. This storage can also be used as shared disk space for containers within the pod. Volumes are mounted at specific mount points within the container, which are defined by the pod configuration, and cannot mount onto other volumes or link to other volumes. The same volume can be mounted at different points in the file system tree by different containers.\\n\\n### ConfigMaps and secrets\\n\\nA common application challenge is deciding where to store and manage configuration information, some of which may contain sensitive data. Configuration data can be anything as fine-grained as individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire configuration files or JSON / XML documents. Kubernetes provides two closely related mechanisms to deal with this need:  \"configmaps\" and \"secrets\", both of which allow for configuration changes to be made without requiring an application build. The data from configmaps and secrets will be made available to every single instance of the application to which these objects have been bound via the deployment. A secret and/or a configmap is sent to a node only if a pod on that node requires it. Kubernetes will keep it in memory on that node. Once the pod that depends on the secret or configmap is deleted, the in-memory copy of all bound secrets and configmaps are deleted as well. The data is accessible to the pod through one of two ways:\\n\\n# as environment variables (which will be created by Kubernetes when the pod is started);\\n\\n# available on the container file system that is visible only from within the pod.\\n\\nThe data itself is stored on the master which is a highly secured machine which nobody should have login access to. The biggest difference between a secret and a configmap is that the content of the data in a secret is base64 encoded. Recent versions of Kubernetes have introduced support for encryption to be used as well. Secrets are often used to store data like certificates, credentials to work with image registries, passwords, and ssh keys.\\n\\n### StatefulSets\\n\\nScaling stateless applications is only a matter of adding more running pods. Stateful workloads are harder, because the state needs to be preserved if a pod is restarted. If the application is scaled up or down, the state may need to be redistributed. Databases are an example of stateful workloads. When run in high-availability mode, many databases come with the notion of a primary instance and secondary instances. In this case, the notion of ordering of instances is important. Other applications like [Kafka](Apache)(Apache Kafka) distribute the data amongst their brokers; hence, one broker is not the same as another. In this case, the notion of instance uniqueness is important.\\n\\nStatefulSets are controllers (see above) that enforce the properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod and can be used to run stateful applications.\\n\\n### Replication controllers and deployments\\n\\nA *ReplicaSet* declares the number of instances of a pod that is needed, and a Replication Controller manages the system so that the number of healthy pods that are running matches the number of pods declared in the ReplicaSet (determined by evaluating its selector).\\n\\nDeployments are a higher-level management mechanism for ReplicaSets. While the Replication Controller manages the scale of the ReplicaSet, Deployments will manage what happens to the ReplicaSet  whether an update has to be rolled out, or rolled back, etc. When deployments are scaled up or down, this results in the declaration of the ReplicaSet changing - and this change in declared state is managed by the Replication Controller.\\n\\n### Labels and selectors\\n\\nKubernetes enables clients (users or internal components) to attach keys called \"labels\" to any API object in the system, such as pods and [nodes](#Kubernetes node). Correspondingly, \"label selectors\" are queries against labels that resolve to matching objects. When a service is defined, one can define the label selectors that will be used by the service router/load balancer to select the pod instances that the traffic will be routed to. Thus, simply changing the labels of the pods or changing the label selectors on the service can be used to control which pods get traffic and which don\\'t, which can be used to support various deployment patterns like [deployment](blue-green)(blue-green deployment)s or [testing](A-B)(A-B testing). This capability to dynamically control how services utilize implementing resources provides a loose coupling within the infrastructure.\\n\\nFor example, if an application\\'s pods have labels for a system tier (with values such as frontend, backend, for example) and a release_track (with values such as [canary](Feature toggle#Canary release), production, for example), then an operation on all of backend and canary nodes can use a label selector, such as:\\n\\ntier=backend AND release_track=canary\\n\\nJust like labels, field selectors also let one select Kubernetes resources. Unlike labels, the selection is based on the attribute values inherent to the resource being selected, rather than user-defined categorization. metadata.name and metadata.namespace are field selectors that will be present on all Kubernetes objects. Other selectors that can be used depend on the object/resource type.\\n\\n### Add-ons\\n\\nAdd-ons operate just like any other application running within the cluster: they are implemented via pods and services, and are only different in that they implement features of the Kubernetes cluster. The pods may be managed by Deployments, ReplicationControllers, and so on. There are many add-ons, and the list is growing. Some of the more important are:\\n\\n; DNS\\n\\n: All Kubernetes clusters should have cluster DNS; it is a mandatory feature. Cluster DNS is a DNS server, in addition to the other DNS server(s) in your environment, which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services. Containers started by Kubernetes automatically include this DNS server in their DNS searches.\\n\\n; Web UI\\n\\n: This is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster, as well as the cluster itself.\\n\\n; Container Resource Monitoring\\n\\n: Providing a reliable application runtime, and being able to scale it up or down in response to workloads, means being able to continuously and effectively monitor workload performance. Container Resource Monitoring provides this capability by recording metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data. The cAdvisor is a component on a slave node that provides a limited metric monitoring capability. There are full metrics pipelines as well, such as Prometheus, which can meet most monitoring needs.\\n\\n; Container Cost Monitoring\\n\\n: Kubernetes cost monitoring apps allows to break down costs by pods, nodes, namespaces, and labels. Three crucial metrics to track are daily cloud spend, cost per provisioned and requested CPU, historical cost allocation.\\n\\n; Cluster-level logging\\n\\n: Logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. Otherwise, node or pod failures can cause loss of event data. The ability to do this is called cluster-level logging, and such mechanisms are responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface. Kubernetes provides no native storage for log data, but one can integrate many existing logging solutions into the Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n### Storage\\n\\nContainers emerged as a way to make software portable. The container contains all the packages you need to run a service. The provided file system makes containers extremely portable and easy to use in development. A container can be moved from development to test or production with no or relatively few configuration changes.\\n\\nHistorically Kubernetes was suitable only for stateless services. However, many applications have a database, which requires persistence, which leads to the creation of persistent storage for Kubernetes. Implementing persistent storage for containers is one of the top challenges of Kubernetes administrators, DevOps and cloud engineers. Containers may be ephemeral, but more and more of their data is not, so one needs to ensure the data\\'s survival in case of container termination or hardware failure. When deploying containers with Kubernetes or containerized applications, companies often realize that they need persistent storage. They need to provide fast and reliable storage for databases, root images and other data used by the containers.\\n\\nIn addition to the landscape, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), has published other information about Kubernetes Persistent Storage including a blog helping to define the container attached storage pattern. This pattern can be thought of as one that uses Kubernetes itself as a component of the storage system or service.\\n\\nMore information about the relative popularity of these and other approaches can be found on the CNCF\\'s landscape survey as well, which showed that OpenEBS from MayaData and Rook  a storage orchestration project  were the two projects most likely to be in evaluation as of the Fall of 2019.\\n\\nContainer Attached Storage is a type of data storage that emerged as Kubernetes gained prominence.  The Container Attached Storage approach or pattern relies on Kubernetes itself for certain capabilities while delivering primarily block, file, object and interfaces to workloads running on Kubernetes.\\n\\nCommon attributes of Container Attached Storage include the use of extensions to Kubernetes, such as custom resource definitions, and the use of Kubernetes itself for functions that otherwise would be separately developed and deployed for storage or data management.  Examples of functionality delivered by custom resource definitions or by Kubernetes itself include retry logic, delivered by Kubernetes itself, and the creation and maintenance of an inventory of available storage media and volumes, typically delivered via a custom resource definition. SNIA|url=https://www.snia.org/educational-library/container-attached-storage-2018|access-date=2020-10-09|website=www.snia.org}}\\n\\n#### Container Storage Interface (CSI)\\n\\nIn Kubernetes version 1.9, the initial Alpha release of Container Storage Interface (CSI) was introduced. Previously, storage volume plug-ins were included in the Kubernetes distribution. By creating a standardized CSI, the code required to interface with external storage systems was separated from the core Kubernetes code base. Just one year later, the CSI feature was made Generally Available (GA) in Kubernetes.\\n\\n## API\\n\\nA key component of the Kubernetes control plane is the API Server, which exposes an HTTP API that can be invoked by other parts of the cluster as well as end users and external components. This API is a [REST](REST) API and is declarative in nature. There are two kinds of API resources. Most of the API resources in the Kubernetes API are objects. These represent a concrete instance of a concept on the cluster, like a pod or namespace. A small number of API resource types are \"virtual\". These represent operations rather than objects, such as a permission check, using the \"subjectaccessreviews\" resource. API resources that correspond to objects will be represented in the cluster with unique identifiers for the objects. Virtual resources do not have unique identifiers.\\n\\n### Operators\\n\\nKubernetes can be extended using Custom Resources. These API resources represent objects that are not part of the standard Kubernetes product. These resources can appear and disappear in a running cluster through dynamic registration. Cluster administrators can update Custom Resources independently of the cluster.\\n\\nCustom Controllers are another extension mechanism. These interact with Custom Resources, and allow for a true declarative API that allows for the lifecycle management of Custom Resource that is aligned with the way that Kubernetes itself is designed. The combination of Custom Resources and Custom Controllers are often referred to as an (Kubernetes) Operator. The key use case for Operators are to capture the aim of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services and to implement them using automation, and with a declarative API supporting this automation. Human operators who look after specific applications and services have deep knowledge of how the system ought to behave, how to deploy it, and how to react if there are problems. Examples of problems solved by Operators include taking and restoring backups of that application\\'s state, and\\n\\nhandling upgrades of the application code alongside related changes such as database schemas or extra configuration settings.\\n\\n### Cluster API\\n\\nThe same API design principles have been used to define an API to programmatically create, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters. This is called the Cluster API. A key concept embodied in the API is using [as Software](Infrastructure)(Infrastructure as Software), or the notion that the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure is itself a resource / object that can be managed just like any other Kubernetes resources. Similarly, machines that make up the cluster are also treated as a Kubernetes resource. The API has two pieces  the core API, and a provider implementation. The provider implementation consists of cloud-provider specific functions that let Kubernetes provide the cluster API in a fashion that is well-integrated with the cloud-provider\\'s services and resources.\\n\\n## Uses\\n\\nKubernetes is commonly used as a way to host a microservice-based implementation, because it and its associated ecosystem of tools provide all the capabilities needed to address key concerns of any [architecture](microservice)(Microservices#A comparison of platforms). It is available in three forms: open source, commercial, and managed. Open source distributions include the original Kubernetes, Amazon EKS-D, [Hat OpenShift](Red)(OpenShift), VMware Tanzu, Mirantis Kubernetes Engine, and D2iQ Kubernetes Platform. Managed offerings include GKE, Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Services, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, [Elastic](Amazon)(Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) Kubernetes Service, IBM Kubernetes Service, and Platform9 Managed Kubernetes.\\n\\n## Distributions\\n\\nVarious vendors offer Kubernetes-based platforms or [as a service](infrastructure)(infrastructure as a service) (IaaS) that deploy Kubernetes.\\n\\nThese include:\\n\\n* [Cloud](Alibaba)(Alibaba Cloud) ACK (Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes)\\n\\n* [Amazon](Amazon (company)) EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)\\n\\n* [Canonical](Canonical (company)) MicroK8s and Charmed Kubernetes\\n\\n* [DigitalOcean](DigitalOcean) managed Kubernetes Service\\n\\n* [Google](Google) GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\\n\\n* [IBM](IBM) Cloud Kubernetes Services\\n\\n* [Microsoft](Microsoft) AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services)\\n\\n* [Mirantis](Mirantis) K0s\\n\\n* [Oracle](Oracle Cloud) Container Engine for Kubernetes\\n\\n* [Hat](Red)(Red Hat) OpenShift\\n\\n* [SUSE](SUSE) Rancher, Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)\\n\\n* [VMware](VMware) Tanzu\\n\\n* [River Systems](Wind)(Wind River Systems) Wind River Studio\\n\\n## Release timeline\\n\\n### Support windows\\n\\nThe chart below visualizes the period for which each release is/was supported\\n\\nImageSize  = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:35\\n\\nPlotArea   = left:100 right:50 bottom:30 top:10\\n\\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\\n\\nPeriod     = from:01/12/2018 till:01/01/2025\\n\\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\\n\\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2019\\n\\nScaleMinor = unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2019\\n\\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\\n\\nColors =\\n\\nid:out_of_support value:rgb(0.992,0.702,0.671) legend:Out_of_support\\n\\nid:in-support     value:rgb(0.996,0.973,0.776) legend:In_support\\n\\nid:latest         value:rgb(0.831,0.957,0.706) legend:Latest_stable_version\\n\\nid:prerelease     value:rgb(0.996,0.82,0.627)  legend:Preview_version\\n\\nPlotData=\\n\\nmark:(line,black)\\n\\nfontsize:S\\n\\nbar:1.27.x from:11/04/2023 till:30/05/2024 text:1.27.x color:latest\\n\\nbar:1.26.x from:09/12/2022 till:24/02/2024 text:1.26.x color:in-support\\n\\nbar:1.25.x from:23/08/2022 till:27/10/2023 text:1.25.x color:in-support\\n\\nbar:1.24.x from:03/05/2022 till:28/07/2023 text:1.24.x color:in-support\\n\\nbar:1.23.x from:07/12/2021 till:28/02/2023 text:1.23.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.22.x from:04/08/2021 till:28/10/2022 text:1.22.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.21.x from:08/04/2021 till:28/06/2022 text:1.21.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.20.x from:08/12/2020 till:28/02/2022 text:1.20.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.19.x from:26/08/2020 till:28/10/2021 text:1.19.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.18.x from:25/03/2020 till:30/04/2021 text:1.18.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.17.x from:09/12/2019 till:30/01/2021 text:1.17.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.16.x from:18/09/2019 till:25/08/2020 text:1.16.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.15.x from:19/06/2019 till:23/03/2020 text:1.15.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.14.x from:25/03/2019 till:09/12/2019 text:1.14.x color:out_of_support\\n\\nbar:1.13.x from:03/12/2018 till:18/09/2019 text:1.13.x color:out_of_support\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n*[(software)](Docker)(Docker (software))\\n\\n*[of cluster management software](List)(List of cluster management software)\\n\\n*[Service Mesh](Open)(Open Service Mesh)\\n\\n*[OpenShift](OpenShift)\\n\\n## References\\n\\n## External links\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n[software](Category:2014)(Category:2014 software)\\n\\n[infrastructure](Category:Cloud)(Category:Cloud infrastructure)\\n\\n[software](Category:Containerization)(Category:Containerization software)\\n\\n[software for cloud computing](Category:Free)(Category:Free software for cloud computing)\\n\\n[software programmed in Go](Category:Free)(Category:Free software programmed in Go)\\n\\n[containerization](Category:Linux)(Category:Linux containerization)\\n\\n[Foundation projects](Category:Linux)(Category:Linux Foundation projects)\\n\\n[using the Apache license](Category:Software)(Category:Software using the Apache license)\\n\\n[software for Linux](Category:Virtualization)(Category:Virtualization software for Linux)\\n\\n[software](Category:Orchestration)(Category:Orchestration software)\\n',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Its primary purpose is to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it a cornerstone technology for managing microservices and large-scale cloud-native workloads. Kubernetes was influenced by Google’s internal Borg system and is written in the Go programming language. Since its release in 2015, it has become the industry standard for container orchestration, with widespread adoption across data centers and cloud vendors, who offer it both as open-source distributions and managed services.\\n\\nAt its core, Kubernetes organizes workloads into logical units called pods, which can contain one or more containers. These pods are scheduled onto nodes (worker machines) and managed according to desired state specifications declared by users or controllers. The Kubernetes control plane, comprised of components such as the API server, etcd (for configuration storage), the scheduler, and controllers, oversees the cluster’s state and ensures workloads are running as intended. Key concepts include namespaces (for resource isolation), services (for stable networking and load balancing), volumes (for persistent storage), and advanced controllers like ReplicaSets, Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets, which enable robust scaling, high availability, and management of both stateless and stateful applications.\\n\\nKubernetes is designed to be extensible and supports a variety of add-ons for features like DNS, web-based UI, monitoring, and logging. It offers a rich API for automation and can be extended through custom resources and controllers, known as Operators, to manage complex application lifecycles. Persistent storage is addressed through the Container Storage Interface (CSI) and the emerging pattern of Container Attached Storage. Today, Kubernetes powers many public and private cloud offerings, underpinning modern DevOps and cloud-native application delivery, with major distributions and managed services available from vendors like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, SUSE, and others.',\n",

Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including Europe, Asia, and Africa.\\n\\nMermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, [shipwreck](shipwreck)s, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same traditions), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.\\n\\nThe male equivalent of the mermaid is the [merman](merman), also a familiar figure in folklore and [heraldry](heraldry). Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as [merfolk](merfolk) or merpeople.\\n\\nThe Western concept of mermaids as beautiful, seductive singers may have been influenced by the [Sirens](Siren (mythology)) of [mythology](Greek)(Greek mythology), which were originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by [Columbus](Christopher)(Christopher Columbus) during his exploration of the [Caribbean](Caribbean), may have been sightings of [manatee](manatee)s or similar aquatic mammals.

Some European Romance languages  still use [cognate](cognate) terms for *siren* to denote the mermaid, e.g., French }} and Spanish and Italian **.\\n\\nSome commentators have sought to trace origins further back into [Ancient Middle Eastern mythology](§)(#Ancient Middle Eastern mythology).\\n\\n### Sirens\\n\\nIn the early Greek period, the sirens were conceived of as human-headed birds,Apollonius Rhodius, *Argonautica* IV, 891–919. [R. C.](Seaton,)(Robert Cooper Seaton) ed., tr. (2012), [p. 354ff](https://books.google.com/books?id=ipANAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA354). \"and at that time they were fashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold\". but by the classical period, the Greeks sporadically depicted the siren as part fish in art., citing ;  and Fig. 3a A [terracotta](terracotta) \"mourning siren\", 250&nbsp;BC, is the oldest representation of siren as mermaid familiar to Waugh.}}\\n\\n#### Medieval sirens as mermaids\\n\\n}}\\n\\n| image2 = BL-Add 11283, fo.020v-siren.jpg\\n\\n| alt2 = Siren in a Second Family bestiary, Additional manuscript\\n\\n| caption2 = Siren in a Second Family bestiary}}\\n\\n| image3 = Bodleian-Library-MS-Bodl-764 00070 fol-074v-sirene.jpg\\n\\n| alt3 = Sirens swimming, in Bodleian bestiary\\n\\n| caption3 = Sirens swimming in sea.}}\\n\\n| footer =\\n\\n}}\\n\\nThe siren\\'s part-fish appearance became increasingly popular during the Middle Ages. The traits of the classical sirens, such as using their beautiful song as a lure as told by Homer, have often been transferred to mermaids.\\n\\nThese change of the medieval siren from bird to fish were thought by some to be the influence of [Teutonic](Teutons) myth, later expounded in literary legends of [Lorelei](Lorelei) and [Undine](Undine); though a dissenting comment is that parallels are not limited to Teutonic culture.\\n\\n#### Textual attestations\\n\\nThe earliest text describing the siren as fish-tailed occurs in the *[Monstrorum de diversis generibus](Liber)(Liber Monstrorum)* (7th–mid 8th cent.), which described sirens as \"sea girls\" (}}) whose beauty in form and sweet song allure seafarers, but beneath the human head and torso, have the [scaly](scale (anatomy)) tail-end of a fish with which they can navigate the sea., pp. 441ff., cited by McCulloch (1962) [1960], p. 167.}}; (both quote from the Orchard (2003) translation.).}}\\n\\n\"Sirens are mermaids\" (Old High German/Early ) is explicit in the aforementioned Old German *Physiologus* (11th century)..

Fig., top right).\\n\\n;(Mirror and comb)\\n\\nWhile the siren holding a fish was a commonplace theme, the siren in bestiaries were also sometimes depicted holding the comb,* Alnwick ms.)}} or the mirror.}}\\n\\nThe comb and mirror became an persistent symbol of the siren-mermaid.\\n\\nIn the Christian moralizing context (e.g the bestiaries), the mermaid\\'s mirror and comb were held as the symbol of vanity. but this church view has been derided as misogynistic from a modern perspective, and it has been noted that the mirror and comb were originally the accoutrements of the love goddess Venus in Classical Times.Warner, Marina *From the Beast to the Blonde*, p. 406 *apud* , Chapter 1. : \"comb and mirror.. probably inherited from the goddess of love, Aphrodite\".}}\\n\\n### Other Greek mythical figures\\n\\nThe sea-monsters [Scylla](Scylla) and [Charybdis](Charybdis), who lived near the sirens, were also female and had some fishlike attributes. Though Scylla\\'s violence is contrasted with the sirens\\' seductive ways by certain classical writers,Xenophon, citing Socrates possibly spuriously, *apud*  Scylla and Charybdis lived near the sirens\\' domain.}} In [civilization](Etruscan)(Etruscan civilization) before the 6th century BC, Scylla was portrayed as a mermaid-like creature with two tails. Some have argued that the two-tailed [Melusine](Melusine) of later European art is traceable to this Etruscan Scylla. A sporadic example of sirens as mermaids (tritonesses) in Early Greek art (3rd century BC), can be explained as the contamination of the siren myth with Scylla and Charybdis.\\n\\nThe female [oceanid](oceanid)s, [nereids](nereids) and [naiad](naiad)s are mythical water nymphs or deities, although not depicted with fish tails. \"Nereid\" and \"nymph\" have also been applied to actual mermaid-like marine creatures purported to exist, from Pliny (cf. [Lusitania and Gaul](§Roman)(#Roman Lusitania and Gaul)) and onwards. [Ellen Harrison](Jane)(Jane Ellen Harrison) (1882) has speculated that the mermaids or tritonesses of Greek and [mythology](Roman)(Roman mythology) may have been brought from the [East](Middle)(Middle East), possibly transmitted by [Phoenicia](Phoenicia)n mariners.\\n\\nThe Greek god [Triton](Triton (mythology)) had two fish tails instead of legs, and later became pluralized as a group. The prophetic sea deity [Glaucus](Glaucus) was also depicted with a fish tail and sometimes with fins for arms.\\n\\n### Ancient Middle Eastern mythology\\n\\n#### Kulullû\\n\\nDepictions of entities with the upper bodies of humans and the tails of fish appear in [Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia)n artwork from the [Babylonian Period](Old)(First Babylonian dynasty) onwards, on [seals](cylinder)(cylinder seals). These figures are usually mermen (*[kulullû](kulullû)*), but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name for the mermaid figure may have been **kuliltu*, meaning \"fish-woman\". Such figures were used in [Neo-Assyrian](Neo-Assyrian Empire) art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small, protective figurines.\\n\\n#### Syrian mermaid goddess\\n\\n[[File:DemetriusIIICoin.png|thumb|[Atargatis](Atargatis) depicted as a fish with a woman\\'s head, on a coin of [III](Demetrius)(Demetrius III Eucaerus)]]\\n\\nA mermaid-like goddess, identified by Greek and Roman writers as Derceto or Atargatis, was worshipped at [Ashkelon](Ashkelon). In a myth recounted by Diodorus in the 1st century BCE, Derceto gave birth to a child from an affair. Ashamed, she abandoned the child in the desert and drowned herself in a lake, only to be transformed into a human-headed fish. The child, [Semiramis](Semiramis), was fed by doves and survived to become a queen.\\n\\nIn the 2nd century AD, [Lucian](Lucian) described seeing a Phoenician statue of Derceto with the upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish. He noted the contrast with the grand statue located at her Holy City ([Bambyce](Hierapolis)(Hierapolis Bambyce)), which appeared entirely human..}}*De Dea Syra*, 14 *apud*\\n\\nIn the myth, Semiramis\\'s first husband is named Onnes. Some scholars have compared this to the earlier Mesopotamian myth of [Oannes](Oannes (mythology)), one of the *[apkallu](apkallu)* or seven sages described as fish-men in [cuneiform](cuneiform) texts.}} While Oannes was a servant of the water deity [Ea](Ea (mythology)), having gained wisdom from the god, English writer [Waugh](Arthur)(Arthur Waugh (author)) understood Oannes to be equivalent to Ea,: \"the first merman in recorded history is the sea-god Ea, or in Greek, Oannes\", and proposed that surely \"Oannes had a fish-tailed wife\" and descendants, with Atargatis being one deity thus descended, \"through the mists of time\".\\n\\nDiodorus\\'s chronology of Queen Semiramis resembles the feats of [the Great](Alexander)(Alexander the Great) (campaigns to India, etc.), and Diodorus may have woven the Macedonian king\\'s material via some unnamed source. There is a mermaid legend attached to Alexander the Great\\'s sister, but this is of post-medieval vintage (see [below](#Byzantine and Ottoman Greece)).\\n\\n### Rational attempts at explanation\\n\\nSometime before 546 BC, [Milesian](Milesian school) philosopher [Anaximander](Anaximander) postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species, a theory that is sometimes called the [Ape Theory](Aquatic)(Aquatic Ape Theory). He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged [infancy](infancy), could not have survived otherwise.\\n\\nThere are also naturalist theories on the origins of the mermaid, postulating they derive from sightings of [manatee](manatee)s, [dugong](dugong)s or even [seals](Pinniped).\\n\\nStill another theory, tangentially related to the aforementioned [Ape Theory](Aquatic)(Aquatic Ape Theory), is that the mermaids of folklore were actually human women who trained over time to be skilled [divers](Underwater diving) for things like [sponges](sponges), and spent a lot of time in the sea as a result. One proponent of this theory is British author [Bond](William)(William Bond (author)), who has written several books about it.\\n\\n## Medieval literature\\n\\n### Merwomen in Germanic literature\\n\\n}}\\n\\n}}\\n\\n#### Nibelungenlied\\n\\nTwo prophetic merwomen (MHG pl.: ), Sigelinde (MHG: Sigelint) and her maternal auntLexer (1872) *Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch*, s.v. \"[muome *swf.*](https://woerterbuchnetz.de/?sigle=Lexer&lemid=LM01525#2)\"..

It has been surmised that in the original complete version, the man was being penalized for spurning her, though the Scandinavian counterparts that tells the complete story feature an elf-woman or elf queen rather than mermaid.\\n\\nMermaids have been described as able to swim up rivers to [freshwater](freshwater) lakes. In one story, the [Laird](Laird) of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; his servant pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.. But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent; e.g., teaching humans cures for certain diseases. [Mermen](Merman) have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids, with little interest in humans.\\n\\nAccording to legend a mermaid came to the [Cornish](Cornwall) village of [Zennor](Zennor), where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella. The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at [Cove](Pendour)(Pendour Cove). On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together.

Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft.

They were considered the mating female and male of the creature, inhabiting the [Sea](North)(North Sea), and their offspring was called  (var. ), as repeated by later commentators.: \"*Havmaend og Havfruer* (mermen and mermaids)\", in the plural\\n\\nThough he was aware of fabulous fables being told about them, he was convinced such creature existed.

According to the superstitions of Swedish fishermen, if one saw a *sjörå*\\u3000who was harbinger of tempest and bad catch, one should not tell his comrades but strike flint against steel to light a spark.\\n\\nIn other cases the Scandinavian mermaid is considered to be prophetic.\\n\\nThe tale type \"[Mermaid\\'s Message](The)(The Mermaid\\'s Message)\" (, ML 4060) is recognized as a , i.e., a group of tales found in Scandinavia with parallels found elsewhere, according to the scheme devised by [Thoralf Christiansen](Reidar)(Reidar Thoralf Christiansen).

She would ask the sailors on any ship she encountered only one question: \"Is King Alexander alive?\",() to which the correct answer was: \"He lives and reigns and conquers the world\" (Greek: \"Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει\"). This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.. This legend derives from an Alexander romance entitled the *Phylláda tou Megaléxandrou* ([του Μεγαλέξανδρου](Φυλλάδα)(:el:Φυλλάδα του Μεγαλέξανδρου)) dating to the [Greece](Ottoman)(Ottoman Greece) period, first printed in 1680.\\n\\n## Eastern Europe\\n\\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|[Repin](Ilya)(Ilya Repin), *[Sadko](Sadko (painting))* (1876)]]\\n\\n[Rusalka](Rusalka)s are the Slavic counterpart of the Greek sirens and [naiad](naiad)s, often seducing sailors to their doom. The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, but according to ethnologist [Zelenin](D.K.)(D.K. Zelenin) they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead.  They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, either by murder or suicide, before their wedding, especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers. They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in Russia, [Ukraine](Ukraine) and [Belarus](Belarus), and was emphasized by 19th-century Russian authors.

She had a unkempt hairdo and scarlet mane extending to the back of her elbows. Zha ordered the crew to bring her aboard with poles, but she escaped. Zha explained that she was a *renyu*, adept at fornicating with humans, and was a type of human dwelling in the sea.

[Cock Blomhoff](Jan)(Jan Cock Blomhoff), the [East India Company](Dutch)(Dutch East India Company) director stationed in [Dejima](Dejima), Nagasaki is known to have acquired merfolk mummies; these and other specimens are now held in the [Museum of Ethnology](National)(National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)) in [Leiden](Leiden), Netherlands.\\n\\n[[File:Mashhad museum PARI DARYAEI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A mummified \"[Devil](Sea)(Sea devil (disambiguation))\" () fish, [Mashhad](Mashhad) Museum, Iran.]]\\n\\nThe equivalent industry in Europe was the [Haniver](Jenny)(Jenny Haniver) made from dried rays.; reprinted in *The Lungfish, the Dodo, and the Unicorn* (New York: Viking, 1948), pp. 57–66: \"And then there existed a European equivalent to the Eastern Mermaid, the \\'Jenny Haniver\\' &nbsp;...\"\\n\\nIn the middle of the 17th century, [Tradescant the elder](John)(John Tradescant the elder) created a [wunderkammer](wunderkammer) (called Tradescant\\'s Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a \"mermaid\\'s hand\".\\n\\n### Mermaid shows\\n\\nScantily clad women placed in watertanks and impersonating mermaids performed at the [New York World\\'s Fair](1939)(1939 New York World\\'s Fair). It was part of the \"Dream of Venus\" installation by [Surrealist](Surrealism) artist [Dalí](Salvador)(Salvador Dalí). The mermaid interacted with Oscar the Obscene Octopus, and the ongoings were portrayed in [L. Doctorow](E.)(E. L.

The state park calls itself \"The Only City of Live Mermaids\" and was extremely popular in the 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified [Scuba](Scuba diving) divers. They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic [ballet](ballet) (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the \"mermaids\" are real. The park\\'s PR director says, \"Just like with [Claus](Santa)(Santa Claus) or any other mythical character, we always say yes. We\\'re not going to tell them they\\'re not real\".\\n\\nThe [Ama](Ama (diver)) are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for [shellfish](shellfish) and [seaweed](seaweed) wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off [reef](reef)s near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.\\n\\n## Scientific inquiry\\n\\nThe topic of mermaids in earnest has arisen in several instances of scientific scrutiny, including a biological assessment of the unlikelihood of the supposed evolutionary biology of the mermaid on the popular [science](marine)(marine science) website *DeepSeaNews*. Five of the primary reasons listed as to why mermaids do not fit current evolutionary understanding are:\\n\\n* [thermoregulation](thermoregulation) (adaptations for regulating body heat);\\n\\n* evolutionary mismatch;\\n\\n* reproductive challenges;\\n\\n* digestive differences between mammals and fish;\\n\\n* lack of physical evidence.\\n\\nMermaids were also discussed  in a scientific article by [of Washington](University)(University of Washington) emeritus oceanographer [Banse](Karl)(Karl Banse).

The title character, youngest of the Merman-king\\'s daughters, falls in love with a human prince and also longs for an eternal [soul](soul) like humans, despite the shorter lifespan. The two cravings are intertwined: only by achieving true love will her soul bind with a human\\'s and become everlasting. But the mermaid\\'s fish-tail poses an insurmountable obstacle for enticing humans, and a sea-witch offers a potion to transform into human form, at a price (the mermaid\\'s tongue and beautiful voice). The mermaid endures the excruciating pain of having human legs, and despite her inability to speak, almost succeeds in wedding the prince, but for a twist of fate. The mermaid is doomed unless she stabs the prince with a magic knife on his wedding night. She refuses to harm him and dies the mermaid way, dissolving into foam. However, her selflessness has earned her a second chance at salvation, and she is resurrected as an air spirit.\\n\\nAndersen\\'s works has been translated into over 100 languages. One of the main literary influences for Andersen\\'s mermaid was *[Undine](Undine (novella))*, an earlier German novella about a water nymph who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human. Andersen\\'s heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in [Copenhagen](Copenhagen) harbour and influenced Western literary works such as [Wilde](Oscar)(Oscar Wilde)\\'s *[Fisherman and His Soul](The)(The Fisherman and His Soul)* and [Wells](H.G.)(H.G. Wells)\\' *[Sea Lady](The)(The Sea Lady)*.\\n\\n[Monk Kidd](Sue)(Sue Monk Kidd) wrote a book called *[Mermaid Chair](The)(The Mermaid Chair)* loosely based on the legends of Saint Senara and the [of Zennor](mermaid)(mermaid of Zennor).\\n\\n### Art and Music\\n\\nSculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 [art](public)(public art) mermaid statues across the world. Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), the United States (including Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada.. Some of these mermaid statues have become icons of their city or country, and are major tourist attractions in themselves. *[Little Mermaid](The)(The Little Mermaid (statue))* statue in Copenhagen is an icon of that city as well as of Denmark. The [Amanda](Havis)(Havis Amanda) statue symbolizes the rebirth of the city of [Helsinki](Helsinki). The Syrenka (mermaid) is part of the [of Arms of Warsaw](coat)(coat of Arms of Warsaw), and is considered a protector of [Warsaw](Warsaw), which publicly displays statues of their mermaid.\\n\\nAn influential image was created by the [Pre-Raphaelite](Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) painter  [William Waterhouse](John)(John William Waterhouse), from 1895 to 1905, entitled *A Mermaid* (Cf. figure, top of page). An example of late British Academy-style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse\\'s place as a member of the [Academy](Royal)(Royal Academy)), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy\\'s collection.. Waterhouse\\'s mermaid grooms her hair with comb and mirror, the stereotypical implements of the mermaid, likely designed to portray her as [temptress](temptress), and her red hair ([hair](auburn)(auburn hair)) is a match for the hair colour of Venus. Waterhouses\\'s *The Siren* (1900) also depicts the siren as a mermaid of sorts, representing the *[fatale](femme)(femme fatale)* , the exact language is \"jeune fille fatale\". drawing men to destruction. In the modern age of course, the word \"siren\" is used as a synonym of *femme fatale*.\\n\\nMermaids were a favorite subject of [Reinhard Weguelin](John)(John Reinhard Weguelin), a contemporary of Waterhouse. He painted an image of the mermaid of Zennor as well as several other depictions of mermaids in watercolour.\\n\\nMusical depictions of mermaids include those by [Mendelssohn](Felix)(Felix Mendelssohn) in his *Fair Melusina* overture and the three \"[daughters](Rhine)(Rhinemaiden)\" in [Wagner](Richard)(Richard Wagner)\\'s opera *[Ring des Nibelungen](Der)(Der Ring des Nibelungen)*. [Lorelei](Lorelei), the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the [Heine](Heinrich)(Heinrich Heine) poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren.  *The Weeping Mermaid* is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer [Ko](Fan-Long)(Fan-Long Ko).\\n\\n### Motion pictures\\n\\nFilm depictions include *[Miranda](Miranda (1948 film))* (1948), *[Tide](Night)(Night Tide)* (1961), the romantic comedy *[Splash](Splash (film))* (1984), and *[Aquamarine](Aquamarine (film))* (2006). A 1963 episode of the television series *[66](Route)(Route 66 (TV series))* entitled \"The Cruelest Sea of All\" featured a mermaid performance artist working at [Wachee](Weeki)(Weeki Wachee) aquatic park.  Mermaids also appeared in the popular supernatural drama television series *[Charmed](Charmed)*. In *[Creature](She)(She Creature)* (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland  and attempt to transport her to America. The film *[of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides](Pirates)(Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides)* mixes old and new myths about mermaids: singing to sailors to lure them to their death, growing legs when taken onto dry land, and bestowing kisses with magical healing properties.\\n\\n[Disney](Disney)\\'s musical animated version of Andersen\\'s tale, *[Little Mermaid](The)(The Little Mermaid (1989 film))*, was released in 1989.

The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid\\'s voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince\\'s love. However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed and the sea-witch is vanquished.  The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying.[Disney Studios](Walt)(The Walt Disney Studios (division)), *The Little Mermaid* (film, 1989).\\n\\n[Miyazaki](Hayao)(Hayao Miyazaki)\\'s *[Ponyo](Ponyo)* is an animated film about a [ningyo](ningyo) who wants to become a human girl with the help of her human friend Sosuke.\\n\\nThe Australian teen [dramedy](dramedy) *[Just Add Water](H2O:)(H2O: Just Add Water)* chronicles the adventures of three modern-day mermaids along the [Coast](Gold)(Gold Coast, Queensland) of Australia.\\n\\nThe [Starbucks](Starbucks) coffee logo is a [melusine](melusine).\\n\\n### Heraldry\\n\\n[[File:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Arms of [Warsaw](Warsaw)]]\\n\\nIn [heraldry](heraldry), the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and [blazon](blazon)ed as a \"mermaid in her vanity\".

A mermaid appears on the arms of the [of Birmingham](University)(University of Birmingham), in addition to those of several British families.\\n\\nA mermaid with two tails is referred to as a [melusine](melusine). Melusines appear in German heraldry, and less frequently in the British version.\\n\\nA shield and sword-wielding mermaid (*[Syrenka](Mermaid of Warsaw)*) is on the official [of arms of Warsaw](coat)(coat of arms of Warsaw).

       "  'answer': 'Mermaids are aquatic mythological beings with the upper body of a human woman and the lower body of a fish, featured in the folklore of many cultures across Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond. Their stories range from being omens of disaster and seductresses leading sailors to their doom, to benevolent figures who grant favors or fall in love with humans. The concept of the mermaid is closely linked with that of the merman, and collectively they are known as merfolk or merpeople. The Western archetype of the mermaid—a beautiful, alluring singer—has roots in the classical Siren of Greek mythology, whose image gradually shifted from bird-woman to fish-woman during the Middle Ages. Historical mermaid sightings, often explained as misidentified aquatic animals like manatees or dugongs, persist into modern times.\\n\\nMermaid legends are widespread and diverse. In the British Isles and Scandinavia, mermaids are often associated with omens, prophecy, and both perilous and helpful deeds. Slavic, African, Asian, and American cultures have their own versions, such as the Slavic rusalka, African Mami Wata, Japanese ningyo, and Caribbean Aycayia. Mermaids also appear in Middle Eastern tales, Indian and Southeast Asian epics, and indigenous legends from places like the Philippines and New Zealand. The characteristics and symbolism of mermaids vary—sometimes reflecting themes of vanity, love, danger, or transformation—and are often intertwined with local beliefs about water spirits and the afterlife. Their image has been shaped by literature, art, religious interpretation, and even hoaxes and sideshow exhibitions throughout history.\\n\\nIn the arts, mermaids have inspired countless works, from Hans Christian Andersen’s \"The Little Mermaid\" to operas, paintings, and films, including Disney\\'s popular adaptation. Statues and heraldic symbols featuring mermaids can be found worldwide, often serving as city icons or emblems of eloquence and vanity. While scientific inquiry finds no evidence for their existence, mermaids remain a prominent fixture in popular culture and fantasy, with modern \"mermaiding\" enthusiasts and performers keeping the myth alive. Their enduring appeal lies in their representation of the border between the known and the mysterious, the human and the otherworldly, and the allure and danger of the sea.',\n",

It was written by series creator and showrunner [Brooker](Charlie)(Charlie Brooker) and William Bridges, and premiered on [Netflix](Netflix) on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three.\\n\\nThe episode tells the story of a teenage boy ([Lawther](Alex)(Alex Lawther)) who is blackmailed into committing bizarre and criminal acts by a mysterious hacker possessing a video of him masturbating. The boy is joined by a middle-aged man ([Flynn](Jerome)(Jerome Flynn)), whom the same hacker is blackmailing over infidelity. The episode is similar to previous *Black Mirror* episodes, particularly \"[Bear](White)(White Bear (Black Mirror))\", and is dark in tone.\\n\\n\"Shut Up and Dance\" received mixed reviews. Critics praised Lawther and Flynn\\'s acting, but were polarised as to whether the episode\\'s tone was effective, whether the plot twist was good and whether the episode had interesting themes. It was ranked poorly in critics\\' lists of *Black Mirror* instalments by quality.\\n\\n## Plot\\n\\nKenny ([Lawther](Alex)(Alex Lawther)) returns home from his restaurant job to find that his sister Lindsey (Maya Gerber) has unintentionally infected his laptop with [malware](malware). Kenny downloads an anti-malware [trojan](Trojan (computing)), allowing unseen hackers to record him masturbating through his webcam; they email the teenager, threatening to leak the footage if he refuses to comply.\\n\\nAt work, Kenny receives a text summoning him to a location  away in 45 minutes. Feigning illness to leave, he frantically cycles there and is met by another blackmail victim ([Jeremiah](Ivanno)(Ivanno Jeremiah)), who passes Kenny a box containing a cake. Ordered to deliver the cake to a hotel room, Kenny meets Hector ([Flynn](Jerome)(Jerome Flynn)), whom the hackers also contact; he planned to commit adultery with a prostitute, and fears he will lose custody of his children if his wife Penny ([Best](Leanne)(Leanne Best)) finds out.\\n\\nThe two are told to drive to a set of coordinates. Stopping for petrol, they meet Karen ([Little](Natasha)(Natasha Little)), a friend of Hector\\'s wife, who requests a lift home. Hector drives recklessly to get her there before continuing to their destination. Tasked with using a gun concealed in the cake to rob a bank, Hector insists on being the driver, leaving Kenny to perform the robbery. Despite urinating in his panic, he manages to steal a bag of cash and flee the scene with Hector.\\n\\nHector is instructed to destroy the car, while Kenny takes the money to a drop-off point in a forest. He meets another victim ([Bazely](Paul)(Paul Bazely)), who explains they are to fight to the death whilst being filmed through a drone; the winner earns the money. When Kenny protests that he was merely masturbating to photos, his opponent asks how young the subjects were, revealing he is a paedophile and implying Kenny is, too. Kenny attempts suicide, but finds the gun is empty. The two fight.\\n\\nArriving home, Hector is texted a [trollface](trollface), finding the blackmailers have sent Penny evidence of his infidelity regardless. The others\\' information is also released. Having killed the man, a shellshocked Kenny staggers from the woods injured. His distraught mother Sandra ([Power](Camilla)(Camilla Power)) calls him, screaming that the video of him masturbating to images of children went live and was seen by Lindsey and her friends. Humiliated, exposed as a paedophile and traumatised by the sadistic demands, Kenny hangs up, receiving a trollface image as police arrive and apprehend him.\\n\\n## Production\\n\\nWhilst series one and two of *Black Mirror* were shown on [4](Channel)(Channel 4) in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes). In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40 million. Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series. \"Shut Up and Dance\" is the third episode of the third series; all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As *Black Mirror* is an [series](anthology)(anthology series), each episode is standalone.\\n\\nThe titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date. A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016. Two days prior to the release of series 3 on Netflix, *Den of Geek!* published an interview in which Brooker hinted that the episode is \"a grimy, contemporary nightmare\" set in London, with no science fiction elements.\\n\\n### Conception and writing\\n\\nThe episode was co-written by series creator [Brooker](Charlie)(Charlie Brooker) and William Bridges, who was new to the television industry. Bridges pitched three ideas to Brooker and executive producer [Jones](Annabel)(Annabel Jones) and although none of them were developed further, he was sent a draft script of \"Shut Up and Dance\" to work on. Brooker stated that the absence of science fiction elements from the episode was a \"very conscious\" decision, noting that science fiction is also absent from series one episode \"[National Anthem](The)(The National Anthem (Black Mirror))\" and series two episode \"[Waldo Moment](The)(The Waldo Moment)\". Having recently written series three episode \"[Junipero](San)(San Junipero)\", which was conceived of as a 1980s [piece](period)(period piece), Brooker was interested in writing a present-day story. He commented that the \"weird, British, colloquial nasty humour\" and \"seediness\" of the episode is similar to \"The National Anthem\".\\n\\nThe story went through many different iterations, starting from an idea similar to 1992 heist film *[Dogs](Reservoir)(Reservoir Dogs)*, where a group of strangers were tossed together to commit a robbery. Some drafts did not imply that Kenny was looking at [pornography](child)(child pornography). In one version of the story, there was no reason why the events were happening, and in another the roles were reversed, with Hector having the extremely dark secret. In a different draft, the hackers were shown in an internet cafe in Eastern Europe, having blackmailed the characters for fun. The episode was originally set in the United States, as this would make it easier for the characters to access a gun, and the timeframe of the storyline was initially longer.\\n\\n### Filming\\n\\n[[File:On set of McMafia with cast (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=photo|[Watkins](James)(James Watkins (director)) directed the episode.]]\\n\\nThe episode was filmed over a three-week period; it was the second in the series to be filmed, after \"San Junipero\". Director [Watkins](James)(James Watkins (director)) had previously directed horror films *[Lake](Eden)(Eden Lake)* (2008) and *[Woman in Black](The)(The Woman in Black (2012 film))* (2012), which Lawther says made Watkins \"really [learn] the craft of sustaining incredible suspense over long periods of time.\" It was Watkins\\' first experience directing television. Having seen art department preparations for series three episodes \"[Nosedive](Nosedive (Black Mirror))\" and \"San Junipero\", Watkins aimed to deviate from their tones to \"embrace being the ugly cousin\". [Lawther](Alex)(Alex Lawther) plays the main character Kenny; having been a fan of the programme prior to auditioning, Lawther particularly liked series two episode \"[Bear](White)(White Bear (Black Mirror))\". When first auditioning, Lawther had only seen the script for a couple of scenes and was unaware of the twist ending.\\n\\nLawther\\'s first proper meeting with co-star [Flynn](Jerome)(Jerome Flynn) was during shooting of in the in-car scenes. Filming was intense, with Flynn [hyperventilating](Hyperventilation) at times, though there was also [corpsing](corpsing) (breaking into laughter) from Flynn, Lawther and Natasha Little, who played Hector\\'s wife\\'s friend Karen. Lawther played Kenny as if he were innocent, as his character is very repressed about his sexual proclivities. He also believed that Kenny feels constantly uncomfortable. Kenny handing a toy back to the girl who had left it behind in the cafe was intended as a hint to Kenny being a paedophile; there were discussions over how the scene should be acted to avoid giving away the twist. After struggling to find a parent who was happy to have their daughter act as the girl, Jones had her own daughter play the role. Lawther commented that whilst filming, he saw a news story similar to the episode\\'s storyline, which he found surreal.\\n\\nThe ending features [Radiohead](Radiohead)\\'s \"[Music (For a Film)](Exit)(Exit Music (For a Film))\", initially included as a temporary track during editing. The producers received permission from Radiohead to use the song as they liked *Black Mirror*.\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\nThe episode was found to be the most similar to prior *Black Mirror* episodes out of those in the third series. Pat Stacey of the *[Independent](Irish)(Irish Independent)* noted that it is the only episode of the series set entirely in England, whilst Alex Mullane of *[Spy](Digital)(Digital Spy)* compared it to a \"British version\" of 1995 action film *[Hard with a Vengeance](Die)(Die Hard with a Vengeance)*, as the main character \"is led on a not-so-merry chase around the city\". Sean Fitz-Gerald of *[Thrillist](Thrillist)* wrote that it is a \"dark thriller\" which is both \"a very atypical and very classic *Black Mirror* story\". The episode\\'s tone was seen by Robbie Collin of *[Daily Telegraph](The)(The Daily Telegraph)* as the \"most nihilistic\" *Black Mirror* episode to that point; he commented that its \"vision of humanity\" is \"uncompromisingly negative\" and that it leaves an \"acrid aftertaste\".\\n\\nStuart Joy, writer of the book *Through the Black Mirror: Deconstructing the Side Effects of the Digital Age*, analysed that the portrayal of Kenny as youthful deceives the viewer and challenges societal perceptions of paedophiles. Lawther said of the script: \"How brilliant [was](it) that they\\'d made me sympathize with a paedophile for so long, and the complexity of that, because he\\'s so young\". His character is 19 years old, a withdrawn and socially-awkward teenager who is easily intimidated by workplace bullies and infantilised by his mother. Joy noted that Kenny\\'s attitude towards sex is indicative of immaturity. Questioned by the much older Hector about what the hackers had caught him doing, Kenny refuses to say the word \"masturbation\", instead using the euphemism \"doing it\". Other moments emphasizing his childlike nature include a series of nervous tics, twitches and stutters exhibited by Kenny, as well as a moment where he urinates himself out of terror when forced to commit a bank robbery.\\n\\nSophie Gilbert of *[Atlantic](The)(The Atlantic)* compared the episode to previous episodes with contemporary settings—series one\\'s \"The National Anthem\" and series two\\'s \"White Bear\" and \"The Waldo Moment\". She also compared it to the 2001 special episode \"Paedogeddon!\" of the television news satire *[Eye](Brass)(Brass Eye)*, which Brooker co-wrote. \"Paedogeddon!\" aimed to \"lampoon the kind of moral panic and mob fury that\\'s unleashed whenever the subject of child abuse is up for debate\". Fitz-Gerald, Gilbert and Zack Handlen of *[A.V. Club](The)(The A.V. Club)* commented that the episode\\'s themes resemble those in \"White Bear\". Handlen wrote that the audience must question \"the danger of unsupervised vigilantism even when the victims arguably deserve what\\'s coming to them\", calling Kenny a \"still sympathetic\" character \"not deserving\" of his punishment, though he is \"disturbed and troubled and in need of some serious counseling\". Fitz-Gerald believed that all of the characters are \"depraved [...] to a degree\", noting that the internet brings out bad behaviour in people.\\n\\nHandlen called the episode \"one of the most pervasive nightmares of the modern age\", as it asks: \"What if someone\\'s watching you at your most vulnerable?\" Mullane opined that the episode is \"a cautionary tale about placing yourself in precarious positions online, particularly when it comes to sexting, images, and pornography\". Fitz-Gerald summarised that the episode was a \"hypothetical extreme\" of hacking and trolling, and asked whether human nature and advanced technology are compatible. However, Caroline Framke of *[Vox](Vox (website))* believed that although the episode \"might ostensibly be about the dangers of hacking, or trying to live a double life in a world that makes secrets all too easy to access\", it relies on the feeling of shame. The episode asks: \"How far would you go to keep your shame safely hidden?\"\\n\\nJosh Dzieza of *[Verge](The)(The Verge)* commented that the anonymous hackers mark \"a bit of a departure\" for the programme, which usually does not feature \"overt villains\". Mullane analysed that the hackers\\' identities do not need to be revealed as they are \"effectively a stand-in for The Internet: all-seeing, all-knowing, and extremely dangerous\". The supposed malware remover that Kenny downloads is called \"shrive\", a word from [English](Middle)(Middle English) meaning \"to prescribe penance\" (the same root word is used for [Tuesday](Shrove)(Shrove Tuesday)). Gilbert commented that in light of this, \"the gauntlet Kenny, Hector, and others are forced to run throughout the episode seems to be a kind of punishment for their sins, but at the end, none of them are forgiven\".\\n\\n## Reception\\n\\n[Tomatoes](Rotten)(Rotten Tomatoes) reported that 65% of critics have given the episode a positive review based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site\\'s critics consensus reads, \"Terrifically tense and twisty, \"Shut Up and Dance\" is well-paced and incredibly unsettling, leaving viewers stunned and with a greater distaste for humanity than normally evoked from an average episode *Black Mirror*.\" \"Shut Up and Dance\" received ratings of five out of five stars by [Collin](Robbie)(Robbie Collin) of *The Daily Telegraph*, four out of five stars by Pat Stacey of *[Irish Independent](The)(The Irish Independent)* and a B class rating by Zack Handlen of *The A.V. Club*. The episode\\'s themes received mixed reception. Mullane wrote that the story was no deeper than one where \"bad people do bad things and then get punished for it\". Gilbert called it redundant to series two episode \"White Bear\", saying that there was \"no clear message or moment of redemption to take away from it\". However, Handlen approved of the episode\\'s themes, praising its \"willingness to force moral questions that make everyone feel awful\".\\n\\nAlex Lawther\\'s performance as Kenny was universally well received. Described by Tim Goodman of *[Hollywood Reporter](The)(The Hollywood Reporter)* as \"one of the best things of 2016\", Handlen concurred that Lawther is \"the real stand-out\" of the episode, while Mullane wrote that he is \"superb in the main role\". Dzieza praised Lawther\\'s portrayal of \"adolescent desperation\", whilst Framke commented that his depiction of Kenny was \"quivering, desperate, heartbreaking\". Framke stated that Lawther\\'s \"incredible, vulnerable performance\" made her \"sympathise with his terror\", which she found crucial to the twist.\\n\\n[[File:Jerome Flynn 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=photo|[Flynn](Jerome)(Jerome Flynn) plays Hector; Alex Mullane of *[Spy](Digital)(Digital Spy)* praised that his character is \"suitably sleazy, without ever being a caricature\".]]\\n\\nJerome Flynn\\'s acting of Hector was also praised. Mullane wrote that his character is \"suitably sleazy, without ever being a caricature\", whilst Framke praised his \"coiled anger\", describing the character as \"gruff and to the point\" and \"furious at his total helplessness\". Dzieza praised Flynn\\'s \"unsettling\" contrast between \"gruffness and utilitarian friendliness\". Collin opined that \"the deliciously horrible details of Flynn’s performance sell you on his character\\'s predicament in a snap\". However, Handlen commented that though Flynn \"does a fine job\", the episode is not a \"showcase\" for him.\\n\\nCritics were polarised as to whether the tone of the episode was effective. Whilst Matt Fowler of [IGN](IGN) wrote that it was \"remarkably heart-pounding\" and Stacey found it \"fantastically tense\", Gilbert commented that it \"felt like too much of an endurance test\" and Framke believed that there was not much suspense prior to the twist ending. Fitz-Gerald experienced a \"mounting sense of anxiety\" as \"Kenny\\'s hopelessness as a puppet to anonymous sociopaths is palpable\", but Adam Chitwood of *[Collider](Collider (website))* found the tension too frustrating, and Handlen wrote that the episode is \"never boring, but it\\'s not all that engaging, either\". Gilbert found it more upsetting than any prior episode, and Dzieza commented that the episode\\'s aesthetics are \"chilly and claustrophobic\". Dzieza further said that the \"queasiness\" up to the twist is \"well orchestrated\", but found the ending \"a letdown\". Stacey said that the episode was \"blackly funny\", with Gilbert concurring that the scenes involving Hector\\'s wife\\'s friend Karen contained some of the darkest humour of the show.\\n\\nThe twist ending in which Kenny is revealed to be a paedophile received a mixed reaction from critics. Handlen opined that it is \"not quite powerful enough to make up for everything that came before it\", with Framke agreeing that it \"doesn\\'t hit that hard\". Fitz-Gerald said that \"I half hate it, half love it.\" Mullane called it \"a huge gut-punch\", but criticised that \"it also removes any anchor for investment in any of these characters\". Dzieza commented that it demonstrated that \"the episode is more interested in turning gadgets into weapons of maximum humiliation than in saying anything more interesting about how digital humiliation works\". However, Mullane opined that the episode\\'s ending \"perfectly captures the bleak mood of the piece and the inescapable claustrophobia of these people\\'s situations\".\\n\\nDirector James Watkins was praised by Mullane and Collin for creating tension, with Collin writing that Watkins \"keeps his camera on its feet and hungry\" during moments of tension and Kenny\\'s chase sequences. However, the episode was criticised as too long by Framke and Chitwood, with Framke attributing this to the programme\\'s move to Netflix.\\n\\n### *Black Mirror* episode rankings\\n\\n\"Shut Up and Dance\" appeared on many critics\\' rankings of the 23 instalments in the *Black Mirror* series, from best to worst.\\n\\n* 8th – Matt Donnelly and Tim Molloy, *[TheWrap](TheWrap)*\\n\\n* 8th – Corey Atad, *[Esquire](Esquire (magazine))*\\n\\n* 15th – Morgan Jeffery and Rosie Fletcher, *[Spy](Digital)(Digital Spy)*\\n\\n* 15th – Charles Bramesco, *[Vulture](Vulture.com)*\\n\\n* 18th – Ed Power, *The Telegraph*\\n\\n* 19th – Aubrey Page, *[Collider](Collider (website))*\\n\\n* 19th – Travis Clark, *[Insider](Business)(Business Insider)*\\n\\n* 23rd – [Hibberd](James)(James Hibberd (writer)), *[Weekly](Entertainment)(Entertainment Weekly)*\\n\\nFollowing the fifth series, Brian Tallerico of *[Vulture](Vulture (magazine))* rated Lawther\\'s performance as Kenny the eleventh best performance in the show.

       "  'answer': '\"Shut Up and Dance\" is the third episode of the third series of the anthology show *Black Mirror*, written by Charlie Brooker and William Bridges, and released on Netflix in October 2016. The episode follows Kenny, a teenage boy blackmailed by anonymous hackers who have compromising footage of him, and Hector, a middle-aged man similarly coerced due to his infidelity. Forced to carry out increasingly criminal acts under the hackers’ instructions—including bank robbery and violence—the story gradually reveals the dark nature of their secrets, culminating in the twist that Kenny is being blackmailed for viewing child pornography. The episode ends bleakly, with the truth exposed to their families and the authorities, regardless of their compliance.\\n\\nProduction-wise, the episode notably eschews the science fiction elements common to *Black Mirror*, opting instead for a grim, realistic portrayal of internet-enabled blackmail and vigilante justice. The writing process involved numerous drafts, with the final version focusing on the psychological torment and moral ambiguity of its characters. Filming was characterized by intense performances, especially from Alex Lawther as Kenny and Jerome Flynn as Hector, both of whom received critical acclaim for their portrayals of desperation and fear. Director James Watkins sought to create a suspenseful, claustrophobic atmosphere, complemented by a haunting soundtrack featuring Radiohead.\\n\\nCritical reception to \"Shut Up and Dance\" was mixed. While reviewers consistently praised the acting and the episode\\'s intense, suspenseful pacing, opinions diverged on its nihilistic tone, the effectiveness of its twist ending, and the depth of its themes. Some critics found the moral ambiguity and lack of redemption compelling, while others saw it as redundant or excessively bleak compared to other episodes in the series. The episode frequently appears in the lower half of *Black Mirror* rankings, but its disturbing exploration of shame, online vulnerability, and the dangers of vigilantism has left a lasting impression on viewers and critics alike.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"*Riverdale* is a teen drama series on The CW, based on Archie Comics characters and adapted by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The show premiered in January 2017 and is filmed in Vancouver, featuring a large ensemble cast led by KJ Apa, Lili Reinhart, Camila Mendes, and Cole Sprouse. The series takes the familiar Archie universe and infuses it with dark, mysterious, and often sensational storylines involving crime, family secrets, and supernatural elements. Over time, *Riverdale* has evolved from a murder-mystery centered on high school students into a sprawling narrative involving cults, serial killers, mobsters, and even surreal occurrences, all while exploring the tangled relationships between the town's youth and their families.\\n\\nThroughout its run, *Riverdale* has delivered numerous dramatic arcs. Early seasons focus on the mysterious death of Jason Blossom and the subsequent unraveling of the small town's secrets. As the show progresses, the stakes are continually raised: the characters face threats like the Black Hood serial killer, the Gryphons and Gargoyles cult, and the manipulations of the Lodge family. The series also incorporates musical episodes, flashbacks, and time jumps, including a significant leap forward after high school graduation that finds the main characters returning to their troubled hometown as adults, now confronting new challenges such as corruption, missing persons, and personal traumas.\\n\\nThe show has been renewed through seven seasons, with the seventh—premiering in March 2023—serving as its final chapter. Over the years, *Riverdale* has maintained a fast-paced, twist-filled narrative style, often blending homage to its comic origins with bold, sometimes controversial storytelling choices. Its enduring popularity is reflected in its consistent renewal and the passionate fanbase following each dramatic twist, cliffhanger, and character evolution.\",\n",

The first General Governor of the city [Menshikov](Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov) is maybe also the author of the first nickname of Petersburg which he called Петри (*Petri*). It took some years until the known Russian spelling of this name finally settled. In 1740s [Lomonosov](Mikhail)(Mikhail Lomonosov) uses a derivative of  (Петрополис, *Petropolis*) in a Russified form \\'\\'Petropol* (Петрополь). A combo *Piterpol* (Питерпол) also appears at this time.Nesterov, V. *Знаешь ли ты свой город* (\"Do you know your city?\"). Leningrad, 1958, p. 58.

Solemn descriptive names like \"the city of three revolutions\" and \"the cradle of the [revolution](October)(October revolution)\" used in the Soviet era are reminders of the pivotal events in national history that occurred here. *Petropolis* is a translation of a city name to Greek, and is also a kind of descriptive name: [Πέτρ-](:el:Πέτρωμα) is a Greek root for \\'stone\\', so the \"city from stone\" emphasizes the material that had been forcibly made obligatory for construction from the first years of the city (the proper Greek translation is Αγία Πετρούπολη, *Agia Petroupoli*).\\n\\nSaint Petersburg has been traditionally called the \"Window to Europe\" and the \"Window to the West\" by the Russians. The city is the [metropolis](northernmost)(list of northernmost items) in the world, and is also often described as the \"[Venice](Venice) of the North\" or the \"Russian Venice\" due to its many water corridors, as the city is built on swamp and water. Furthermore, it has strongly Western European-inspired architecture and culture, which is combined with the city\\'s Russian heritage. Another nickname of Saint Petersburg is \"The City of the White Nights\" because of a natural phenomenon which arises due to the closeness to the [region](polar)(polar regions of Earth) and ensures that in summer the night skies of the city do not get completely dark for a month. The city is also often called the \"Northern [Palmyra](Palmyra)\", due to its extravagant architecture.\\n\\n## History\\n\\n### Imperial era (1703–1917)\\n\\n[[File:Bronze Horseman 02.jpg|right|220px|thumb|The *[Horseman](Bronze)(Bronze Horseman)*, monument to Peter the Great]]\\n\\n[[spb 1744 high.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of Saint Petersburg, 1744](File:Map)]\\n\\n[[of fortifications, Sankt Petersburg, 1722](File:Kungsboken-karta-sankt-petersburg.jpg|thumb|Map)]\\n\\nSwedish colonists built [Nyenskans](Nyenschantz), a fortress at the mouth of the [Neva](Neva) River in 1611, which was later called [Ingermanland](Ingria). This area was inhabited by a [Finnic](Baltic Finnic peoples) tribe of [Ingrians](Ingrian Finns). The small town of Nyen grew up around the fort.\\n\\nAt the end of the 17th century, Peter the Great, who was interested in seafaring and maritime affairs, wanted Russia to gain a seaport to trade with the rest of Europe. He needed a better seaport than the country\\'s main one at the time, [Arkhangelsk](Arkhangelsk), which was on the [Sea](White)(White Sea) in the far north and closed to shipping during the winter.\\n\\nOn , during the [Northern War](Great)(Great Northern War), [the Great](Peter)(Peter the Great) captured Nyenskans and soon replaced the fortress. On , closer to the [estuary](estuary) ( inland from the [gulf](Gulf of Finland)), on [(Hare) Island](Zayachy)(Hare Island (Saint Petersburg)), he laid down the [and Paul Fortress](Peter)(Peter and Paul Fortress), which became the first brick and stone building of the new city.\\n\\nThe city was built by [peasants](conscripted)(Serfdom) from all over Russia; in some years several Swedish [of war](prisoners)(Prisoner of war) were also involved under the supervision of [Menshikov](Alexander)(Alexander Danilovich Menshikov). Tens of thousands of serfs died while building the city. Later, the city became the centre of the [Petersburg Governorate](Saint)(Saint Petersburg Governorate). Peter moved the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg in 1712, 9 years before the [of Nystad](Treaty)(Treaty of Nystad) of 1721 ended the war. He referred to Saint Petersburg as the capital (or seat of government) as early as 1704. While the city was being built, Peter lived in a three-room log cabin with his wife Catherine and their children.\\n\\n[[Nevsky Prospekt from Police Bridge to City Duma, photochrome 1896-1897.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Nevsky Prospekt from restaurant Legeune in the late 19th century](File:SPB)]\\n\\nDuring its first few years, the city developed around Trinity Square on the right bank of the Neva, near the Peter and Paul Fortress. However, Saint Petersburg soon started to be built out according to a plan. By 1716 the [Italian](Swiss)(Swiss Italian) [Trezzini](Domenico)(Domenico Trezzini) had elaborated a project whereby the city centre would be on [Island](Vasilyevsky)(Vasilyevsky Island) and shaped by a rectangular grid of canals. The project was not completed but is evident in the layout of the streets. In 1716, Peter the Great appointed Frenchman [Alexandre Le Blond](Jean-Baptiste)(Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond) as the [architect](chief)(Architecture) of Saint Petersburg.\\n\\nThe style of [Baroque](Petrine)(Petrine Baroque), developed by Trezzini and other architects and exemplified by such buildings as the [Palace](Menshikov)(Menshikov Palace (Saint Petersburg)), [Kunstkamera](Kunstkamera), [and Paul Cathedral](Peter)(Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg), [Collegia](Twelve)(Twelve Collegia), became prominent in the city architecture of the early 18th century. In 1724 the [of Sciences](Academy)(Russian Academy of Sciences), [University](Saint Petersburg State University) and Academic Gymnasium were established in Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great.\\n\\nIn 1725, Peter died at age fifty-two. His endeavors to modernize Russia had been opposed by the [nobility](Russian)(Russian nobility). There were several attempts on his life and a treason case involving his son.Matthew S. Anderson, *Peter the Great* (London: [and Hudson](Thames)(Thames & Hudson), 1978) In 1728, [II of Russia](Peter)(Peter II of Russia) moved his seat back to Moscow. But four years later, in 1732, under Empress [of Russia](Anna)(Anna of Russia), Saint Petersburg was again designated as the capital of the [Empire](Russian)(Russian Empire). It remained the seat of the [dynasty](Romanov)(House of Romanov) and the Imperial Court of the [tsars](Russian)(List of Russian monarchs), as well as the seat of the Russian government, for another 186 years until the [revolution of 1917](communist)(Russian Revolution).\\n\\nIn 1736–1737 the city suffered from catastrophic fires. To rebuild the damaged boroughs, a committee under [Christoph von Münnich](Burkhard)(Burkhard Christoph von Münnich) commissioned a new plan in 1737. The city was divided into five boroughs, and the city centre was moved to the Admiralty borough, on the east bank between the Neva and [Fontanka](Fontanka).\\n\\n[[File:Дворцовая_площадь_Санкт-Петербурга._Вид_из_Эрмитажа..JPG|thumb|[Square](Palace)(Palace Square) backed by the [staff arch and building](General)(General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)).

[architecture](Constructivist)(Constructivist architecture) flourished around that time. Housing became a government-provided [amenity](social utility); many \"bourgeois\" apartments were so large that numerous families were assigned to what were called \"communal\" apartments (*[kommunalkas](kommunal apartment)*). By the 1930s, 68% of the population lived in such housing under very poor conditions. In 1935, a new general plan was outlined, whereby the city should expand to the south. Constructivism was rejected in favour of a more pompous [architecture](Stalinist)(Stalinist architecture). Moving the city centre further from the border with Finland, [Stalin](Joseph Stalin) adopted a plan to build a new city hall with a huge adjacent square at the southern end of [Prospekt](Moskovsky)(Moskovsky Prospekt), designated as the new main street of Leningrad. After the [(Soviet-Finnish) war](Winter)(Winter War) in 1939–1940, the Soviet–Finnish border moved northwards.

The five most disastrous floods occurred in 1824 ( above sea level, during which over 300 buildings were destroyed above sea level}}); 1924 (); 1777 (); 1955 (); and 1975 (). To prevent floods, the [Petersburg Dam](Saint)(Saint Petersburg Dam) has been constructed.Nezhikhovsky, R.A. *Река Нева и Невская губа* [Neva River and Neva Bay*](*The), Leningrad: Gidrometeoizdat, 1981.\\n\\nSince the 18th century, the city\\'s terrain has been raised artificially, at some places by more than , making mergers of several islands, and changing the hydrology of the city.

For various reasons (including large-scale destruction during [War II](World)(World War II) and construction of modern buildings during the postwar period in the largest historical centres of Europe), Saint Petersburg has become a unique reserve of European architectural styles of the past three centuries. Saint Petersburg\\'s loss of capital city status helped it retain many of its pre-revolutionary buildings, as modern architectural \\'prestige projects\\' tended to be built in Moscow; this largely prevented the rise of mid-to-late-20th century architecture and helped maintain the architectural appearance of the historic city centre.\\n\\n[[File:Andrey Zeest - Amber Room 2 (autochrome).jpg|thumb|left|The [Room](Amber)(Amber Room) in the [Palace](Catherine)(Catherine Palace)]]\\n\\nSaint Petersburg is inscribed on the [UNESCO](UNESCO) World Heritage list as an area with 36 historical architectural complexes and around 4000 outstanding individual monuments of architecture, history and culture.

In 1956 the popular ensemble Druzhba was founded by Aleksandr Bronevitsky and [Piekha](Edita)(Edita Piekha) to become the first popular band in the USSR during the 1950s. In the 1960s student rock-groups Argonavty, Kochevniki and others pioneered a series of unofficial and [rock](underground)(underground music) concerts and festivals. In 1972 [Grebenshchikov](Boris)(Boris Grebenshchikov) founded the band [Aquarium](Aquarium (band)), which later grew to huge popularity.

[Dostoyevsky](Fyodor Dostoyevsky) called it \"The most abstract and intentional city in the world\", emphasizing its artificiality, but it was also a symbol of modern disorder in a changing Russia. It often appeared to [writers](Russian)(List of Russian language writers) as a menacing and inhuman mechanism. The grotesque and often nightmarish image of the city is featured in Pushkin\\'s last poems, the Petersburg stories of [Gogol](Nikolai Gogol), the novels of [Dostoyevsky](Fyodor Dostoyevsky), the verse of [Blok](Alexander)(Alexander Blok) and [Mandelshtam](Osip)(Osip Mandelstam), and in the symbolist novel *[Petersburg](Petersburg (novel))* by [Bely](Andrey)(Andrei Bely). According to Lotman in his chapter, \\'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg\\' in *Universe and the Mind*, these writers were inspired by symbolism from within the city itself. The effect of life in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as [Pushkin](Alexander Pushkin), Gogol, and Dostoyevsky. Another important feature of early Saint Petersburg literature is its mythical element, which incorporates [legend](urban)(urban legend)s and popular [stories](ghost)(ghost story), as the stories of Pushkin and Gogol included ghosts returning to Saint Petersburg to haunt other characters as well as other fantastical elements, creating a surreal and abstract image of Saint Petersburg.\\n\\n20th-century writers from Saint Petersburg, such as [Nabokov](Vladimir)(Vladimir Nabokov), [Rand](Ayn)(Ayn Rand), Andrey Bely and [Zamyatin](Yevgeny)(Yevgeny Zamyatin), along with his apprentices, The [Brothers](Serapion)(Serapion Brothers) created entirely new styles in literature and contributed new insights to the understanding of society through their experience in this city. [Akhmatova](Anna)(Anna Akhmatova) became an important leader for [poetry](Russian)(List of Russian language poets). Her poem *Requiem* adumbrates the perils encountered during the Stalinist era. Another notable 20th-century writer from Saint Petersburg is [Brodsky](Joseph)(Joseph Brodsky), recipient of the [Prize in Literature](Nobel)(Nobel Prize in Literature) (1987). While living in the United States, his writings in English reflected on life in Saint Petersburg from the unique perspective of being both an insider and an outsider to the city in essays such as, \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" and the nostalgic \"In a Room and a Half\".Joseph Brodsky. *Less Than One: Selected Essays*, 1986\\n\\n### Film\\n\\n[[File:Константин хабенский.jpg|thumb|[Khabensky](Konstantin)(Konstantin Khabensky), known for his roles in *[Watch](Night)(Night Watch (2004 film))*, *[Watch](Day)(Day Watch (film))* and *[Admiral](The Admiral (2008 film))*, is a native of Saint Petersburg.]]\\n\\nOver 250 international and Russian movies were filmed in Saint Petersburg.

The first foreign feature movie filmed entirely in Saint Petersburg was the 1997 production of Tolstoy\\'s *[Karenina](Anna)(Anna Karenina (1997 film))*, starring [Marceau](Sophie)(Sophie Marceau) and [Bean](Sean)(Sean Bean) and made by an international team of British, American, French and Russian filmmakers.\\n\\nThe cult comedy *[of Fate](Irony)(The Irony of Fate)* (also Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!) is set in Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet city planning. The 1985 film *[Nights](White)(White Nights (1985 film))* received considerable Western attention for having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes at a time when filming in the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union) by Western production companies was generally unheard of. Other movies include *[GoldenEye](GoldenEye)* (1995), *[in Saint Petersburg](Midnight)(Midnight in Saint Petersburg)* (1996), *[Brother](Brother (1997 film))* (1997) and [Tamil](Tamil cinema) romantic [film](thriller)(thriller (genre))-*[Dhoom](Dhaam)(Dhaam Dhoom)* (2008). *[Onegin](Eugene Onegin#Film)* (1999) is based on the [Pushkin](Alexander Pushkin) poem and showcases many [attraction](tourist)(tourist attraction)s. In addition, the Russian romantic comedy, *[FM](Piter)(Piter FM)*, intricately showcases the cityscape, almost as if it were a main character in the film.\\n\\nSeveral international film festivals are held annually, such as the [of Festivals, Saint Petersburg](Festival)(Festival of Festivals, Saint Petersburg), as well as the Message to Man International Documentary Film Festival, since its inauguration in 1988 during the White Nights.\\n\\n### Dramatic theatre\\n\\nSt Petersburg has a number of dramatic theatres and drama schools.

Abrams](J.)(J. J. Abrams) and written by [Orci](Roberto)(Roberto Orci), [Kurtzman](Alex)(Alex Kurtzman), and [Lindelof](Damon)(Damon Lindelof). It is the 12th installment in the *[Trek](Star)(Star Trek)* franchise and the sequel to the 2009 film *[Trek](Star)(Star Trek (film))*, as the second in a [rebooted](reboot (fiction)) film series. It features [Pine](Chris)(Chris Pine) reprising his role as Captain [T. Kirk](James)(James T. Kirk), with [Quinto](Zachary)(Zachary Quinto), [Pegg](Simon)(Simon Pegg), [Urban](Karl)(Karl Urban), [Saldana](Zoe)(Zoe Saldana), [Cho](John)(John Cho), [Yelchin](Anton)(Anton Yelchin), [Greenwood](Bruce)(Bruce Greenwood), and [Nimoy](Leonard)(Leonard Nimoy) reprising their roles from the previous film. [Cumberbatch](Benedict)(Benedict Cumberbatch), [Eve](Alice)(Alice Eve), and [Weller](Peter)(Peter Weller) are also in the film\\'s principal cast. It was Nimoy\\'s last film appearance before his death in 2015. Set in the [century](23rd)(23rd century), the film follows Kirk and the crew of [*Enterprise*](USS)(USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)) as they are sent to the [Klingon](Klingon) homeworld seeking a former [Starfleet](Starfleet) member-turned-terrorist, [Harrison](John)(Khan Noonien Singh).\\n\\nAfter the release of *Star Trek*, Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Kurtzman, and Orci agreed to produce its sequel. Filming began in January 2012. *Into Darkness*s visual effects were created by Lucasfilm\\'s [Light & Magic](Industrial)(Industrial Light & Magic). The film was [converted](2D to 3D conversion) to [3D](3D film) during its post-production stage.\\n\\nIt premiered at [Cinemas](Event)(Event Cinemas) in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, and was released in [IMAX](IMAX) theaters in the U.S. on May 15, 2013, with release in standard-format theaters the next day. *Into Darkness* was a financial success and received positive reviews from critics. Its gross earnings of over $467 million worldwide have made it the highest-grossing entry in the *[Trek](Star)(Star Trek)* franchise. It was nominated for [Visual Effects](Best)(Academy Award for Best Visual Effects) at the [Academy Awards](86th)(86th Academy Awards). It was followed by *[Trek Beyond](Star)(Star Trek Beyond)* in 2016.\\n\\n## Plot\\n\\nIn 2259, Captain [T. Kirk](James)(James T. Kirk) is removed from command of the starship [*Enterprise*](USS)(USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)) for violating the [Directive](Prime)(Prime Directive) by revealing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral [Pike](Christopher)(Christopher Pike (Star Trek)) is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to first officer. [Spock](Spock) is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, Starfleet officer Thomas Harewood, sent by Commander John Harrison, bombs a [31](Section)(Section 31 (Star Trek)) installation in [London](London). During an emergency meeting on the situation, Harrison uses a ship to ambush and kill Pike and other senior officers, before transporting to [Kronos](Klingon#Homeworld), homeworld of the hostile [Klingon](Klingon)s.\\n\\nAdmiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to *Enterprise* with orders to kill Harrison using a new long range stealth torpedo. Chief Engineer [Scott](Montgomery)(Scotty (Star Trek)) objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns [Chekov](Pavel)(Pavel Chekov) to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, *Enterprise*s warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and [Uhura](Uhura) to the planet, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols. Harrison appears and kills the Klingons. Harrison surrenders when he learns the precise number of torpedoes on board *Enterprise*.\\n\\nDr. [McCoy](Leonard)(Leonard McCoy) and Marcus\\'s daughter, Dr. [Marcus](Carol)(Carol Marcus (Star Trek)), open a torpedo at Harrison\\'s urging, revealing the torpedoes contain [cryonically-frozen](cryonics) humans. Harrison is taken to *Enterprise*s brig, where he reveals his true identity as [Noonien Singh](Khan)(Khan Noonien Singh), a genetically engineered superhuman, awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of sleep and forced to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged *Enterprise*s warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, sparking war with the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates, which Kirk asks Scott to investigate. Scott discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility.\\n\\n*Enterprise* is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS *Vengeance*, commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but *Enterprise* flees to Earth to expose him. After *Vengeance* disables *Enterprise* near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard *Enterprise* to stop the attack. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to *Vengeance* before ordering *Enterprise*s destruction. *Vengeance* loses power after being sabotaged by Scott, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latter\\'s knowledge of the warship\\'s design, [space-jump](space diving) to *Vengeance*. Meanwhile, Spock contacts his future self on New Vulcan, who tells him of [own encounter with Khan](his)(Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) and warns that he cannot be trusted. After fighting their way to the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott, and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of *Vengeance*.\\n\\nKhan demands that Spock return his frozen crew in exchange for the *Enterprise* officers. Spock complies, having had McCoy surreptitiously remove Khan\\'s frozen crew from the torpedoes beforehand. When Khan starts shooting at *Enterprise*, Spock detonates the warheads, crippling the ship. With both starships caught in Earth\\'s gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters *Enterprise*s radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.\\n\\nKhan crashes *Vengeance* into downtown [Francisco](San)(San Francisco) in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters, while McCoy discovers that Khan\\'s blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. A vengeful Spock pursues Khan through the city and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat. Uhura beams down and stuns Khan. Spock prepares to kill Khan, but Uhura stops him, explaining he is their only chance to save Kirk. Khan\\'s blood revives Kirk and Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. One year later, Kirk speaks at *Enterprise*s re-dedication ceremony. The *Enterprise* crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission.\\n\\n## Cast\\n\\n* [Pine](Chris)(Chris Pine) as [James T.

[Langenkamp](Heather)(Heather Langenkamp) portrays Moto, a character she describes as a small role. Finally, [Blain](Ser\\'Darius)(Ser\\'Darius Blain) appears as a [redshirt](Redshirt (stock character)).\\n\\n## Production\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nIn June 2008, it was reported that [Pictures](Paramount)(Paramount Pictures) was interested in signing producers of the 2009 *Star Trek* [J. Abrams](J.)(J. J. Abrams), [Burk](Bryan)(Bryan Burk), [Lindelof](Damon)(Damon Lindelof), [Kurtzman](Alex)(Alex Kurtzman), and [Orci](Roberto)(Roberto Orci) for a sequel. In March 2009, it was reported that these five producers had agreed to produce the film, with a script again written by Orci and Kurtzman (with the addition of Lindelof). A preliminary script was said to be completed by Christmas 2009 for a 2011 release. Kurtzman and Orci began writing the script in June 2009, originally intending to split the film into two parts. [Nimoy](Leonard)(Leonard Nimoy), the original [Spock](Spock) who plays an older version of the character in the 2009 film, said he would not appear in the film. Abrams was reportedly considering [Shatner](William)(William Shatner) for the sequel.\\n\\nBy 2010, a release date of June 29, 2012, was set, with Lindelof announcing he had begun working on the script with Kurtzman and Orci. Pre-production was set for January 2011, although Burk said actual filming would probably begin during the spring or summer. Actor [Quinto](Zachary)(Zachary Quinto) later said that these reports were untrue. Lindelof compared the sequel to *[Dark Knight](The)(The Dark Knight (film))*.\\n\\nAbrams, Kurtzman, and Orci said that selecting a villain was difficult; according to Abrams, \"the universe [Roddenberry](Gene Roddenberry) created is so vast that it\\'s hard to say one particular thing stands out\". They also discussed the possibility of [Noonien Singh](Khan)(Khan Noonien Singh) and [Klingon](Klingon)s. Kurtzman and Lindelof said they had \"broken\" the story (created an outline); instead of a sequel, it will be a stand-alone film. Abrams admitted in December 2010 that there was still no script.\\n\\nIn January 2011, Abrams said he had not decided whether or not he would direct, since he had not yet seen a script. [Pictures](Paramount)(Paramount Pictures) then approached him, asking that the sequel be in [3D](3D film). Abrams said that the film would not be shot in 3D, but filmed in 2D and [during post-production](converted)(2D to 3D conversion). He was also interested in filming in [IMAX](IMAX): \"IMAX is my favorite format; I\\'m a huge fan.\" In February, Orci [tweeted](Twitter) that he (with Lindelof and Kurtzman) planned to deliver the script in March 2011. Although the script was not finished on schedule, Paramount began financing pre-production; similar circumstances on the next [Ryan](Jack)(Jack Ryan (character)) film meant that [Pine](Chris)(Chris Pine) would film the *Star Trek* sequel first. By April, Orci said at [WonderCon](WonderCon) that the script\\'s first draft had been completed. Abrams told [MTV](MTV) that when he finished his film, *[8](Super)(Super 8 (2011 film))*, he would turn his full attention to the *Trek* sequel.\\n\\nAlthough a script was completed, uncertainty regarding the extent of Abrams\\'s involvement led to the film\\'s being pushed back six months from its scheduled June 2012 release. Other factors which precluded the release, ending up pushing it further back were the high budget and overall difficulty of finding actors to fit the roles. In June, Abrams confirmed that his next project would be the sequel, noting that he would rather the film be good than ready by its scheduled release date. [Pegg](Simon)(Simon Pegg), who played [Scotty](Scotty (Star Trek)), said in an interview that he thought filming would begin during the latter part of the year. Abrams stated he would prioritize the film\\'s story and characters over an early release date. In September, Abrams agreed to direct the film, with the cast from the previous film reprising their respective roles for a winter 2012 or summer 2013 release. In October, Orci said that [scouting](location)(location scouting) was underway, and a [book](comic)(comic book) series (of which Orci would be creative director) would \"foreshadow\" the film. *Into Darkness* was given a revised release date of 2013, and [Giacchino](Michael)(Michael Giacchino) confirmed that he would return to write the score.\\n\\nLindelof said that Khan was considered a character they needed to use at some point, given that \"he has such an intense gravity in the *Trek* universe, we likely would have expended more energy NOT putting him in this movie than the other way around.\" References to *[Trek II: The Wrath of Khan](Star)(Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)* were eventually added to the script, but Lindelof, Orci, and Kurtzman \"were ever wary of the line between \\'reimagined homage\\' and \\'direct ripoff\\'.\" Orci and Kurtzman said they wanted a film which would work on its own and as a sequel, not using ideas from previous *Star Trek* works simply \"because you think people are going to love it\". Orci noted that when trying to create the \"gigantic imagery\" required by a summer blockbuster, Kurtzman suggested a scene where *Enterprise* rose from the ocean. With that as a starting point they (and Lindelof) came up with the [open](cold)(cold open) in Nibiru, which blended action and comedy and was isolated from the main story in an homage to *[of the Lost Ark](Raiders)(Raiders of the Lost Ark)*.\\n\\nActor [del Toro](Benicio)(Benicio del Toro) had reportedly been sought as the villain, and had met with Abrams to discuss the role; however, he later bowed out. In 2011, [Eve](Alice)(Alice Eve) and [Weller](Peter)(Peter Weller) agreed to their roles. *[Who](Doctor)(Doctor Who)* actor [Clarke](Noel)(Noel Clarke) agreed to an unknown role, reported to be \"a family man with a wife and young daughter\". [Bichir](Demián)(Demián Bichir) auditioned for the villain role, but as reported by *[Variety](Variety (magazine))* on January 4, 2012, [Cumberbatch](Benedict)(Benedict Cumberbatch) was cast.\\n\\n### Filming\\n\\n*Into Darkness* began [photography](principal)(principal photography) on January 12, 2012, with a scheduled release date of May 16, 2013. Cinematographer [Mindel](Dan)(Daniel Mindel) shot the film using a combination of [anamorphic](Anamorphic format) [film](35mm)(35mm movie film) and 15 perforation [IMAX](IMAX) cameras. About 30 minutes of the film is shot in the IMAX format, while some other scenes were also shot on 8 perforation [65mm](70mm). *Into Darkness* was released in 3D. On February 24, 2012, images from the set surfaced of Benedict Cumberbatch\\'s character in a fight with Spock. [Wright](Edgar)(Edgar Wright) directed one shot in the film.\\n\\nProduction ended in May 2012.[\"zq. picture wrap. holy shit.\"](https://twitter.com/ZacharyQuinto/status/200029006400192512) . [Twitter](Twitter). Retrieved June 7, 2012.\\n\\nFilming was done on location in [Angeles](Los)(Los Angeles), California, and around the area at the [Livermore National Laboratory](Lawrence)(Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) in [Livermore](Livermore, California). Additional locations included [Studios](Paramount)(Paramount Studios) in [Hollywood](Hollywood, Los Angeles), Sony Pictures Studios in [City](Culver)(Culver City), the [Cathedral](Crystal)(Crystal Cathedral) in [Grove](Garden)(Garden Grove, California), and the [Mansion](Greystone)(Greystone Mansion) in [Hills](Beverly)(Beverly Hills). Some shots were made in [Iceland](Iceland).\\n\\n[Okrand](Marc)(Marc Okrand), the developer of the [language](Klingon)(Klingon language), provided the Klingon dialogues with on-set coaching from constructed language experts. The dialogue did not make cohesive sense following [editing](Rough cut) and so new dialogue was constructed and dubbed during post production.\\n\\n### Title\\n\\nOn September 10, 2012, Paramount confirmed the film\\'s title as *Star Trek Into Darkness*. Abrams had indicated that unlike some of the earlier films in the franchise, his second *Star Trek* would not include a number in its title. This decision was made to avoid repeating the sequel numbering which began with *[Trek II: The Wrath of Khan](Star)(Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)*, or making a confusing jump from *Star Trek * to *Star Trek 12*. Lindelof addressed the team\\'s struggle to agree on a title: \"There have been more conversations about what we\\'re going to call it than went into actually shooting it... There\\'s no word that comes after the colon after *Star Trek* that\\'s cool. Not that *Star Trek: Insurrection* or *First Contact* aren\\'t good titles, it\\'s just that everything that people are turned off about when it comes to *Trek* is represented by the colon\". Of the titles proposed, he joked that he preferred *Star Trek: Transformers 4* best because the title is \"technically available\".\\n\\n## Themes\\n\\nOn May 10, 2013, Cho, Pegg, and Eve were interviewed on *[Bob Rivers Show](The)(The Bob Rivers Show)* to promote the film. Rivers asked about the title: \"The title *Star Trek Into Darkness* indicates some sort of ominous turn, obviously\". Eve suggested that Pegg discuss the theme of [terrorism](terrorism), and Pegg obliged: \"I think it\\'s a very current film, and it reflects certain things that are going on in our own heads at the moment; this idea that our enemy might be walking among us, not necessarily on the other side of an ocean, you know. John Harrison, Benedict Cumberbatch\\'s character, is ambiguous, you know? We [characters in the film](the) don\\'t know who to support. Sometimes, Kirk, he seems to be acting in exactly the same way as him [Harrison]. They\\'re both motivated by revenge. And the *Into Darkness* in the title is less an idea of this new trend of po-faced, kind of, everything\\'s-got-to-be-a-bit-dour treatments of essentially childish stories. It\\'s more about Kirk\\'s indecision.\" Cho agreed about the characterization of Captain Kirk: \"It\\'s his crisis of leadership.\"\\n\\nThe pivotal scene near the end when Kirk enters the reactor chamber serves as a role reversal of a similar pivotal scene in *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.*\\n\\nOriginally conceived as a retelling of *[of Darkness](Heart)(Heart of Darkness)* by [Conrad](Joseph)(Joseph Conrad), Kurtzman and Orci defined the main theme of *Into Darkness* as \"how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us. How far should we go from our values?\" They added that running from personal values is a personal struggle, where \"the enemy\\'s blood is within us; we are the enemy. We must not succumb to it; we are the same.\"\\n\\n## Music\\n\\nComposer [Giacchino](Michael)(Michael Giacchino) composed the film\\'s [music](incidental)(Film score). *Into Darkness* was Giacchino\\'s fourth film collaboration with Abrams, which included *[Trek](Star)(Star Trek (film))* (2009). The film score was recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California from March 5 to April 3, 2013. Its soundtrack album was released digitally on May 14, 2013, and was made available on May 28 through [Sarabande](Varèse)(Varèse Sarabande). The score contains the original [Trek* theme](*Star)(Theme from Star Trek) by [Courage](Alexander)(Alexander Courage).\\n\\nOn April 24, 2013, it was announced that British singer [Bruce](Bo)(Bo Bruce) and Irish songwriter [Lightbody](Gary)(Gary Lightbody) of [Patrol](Snow)(Snow Patrol) had collaborated on a song for the film\\'s soundtrack entitled \"The Rage That\\'s In Us All\".\"[Bo Bruce : Voice finalist set to sing in Star Trek Into Darkness movie](http://stillgotthefever.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/bo-bruce-voice-finalist-set-to-sing-in.html)\" Still Got The Fever (April 24, 2013).

Retrieved April 24, 2013.\\n\\nAn expanded soundtrack album was released on July 28, 2014, limited to 6,000 copies.\\n\\n## Marketing\\n\\nAs part of a contest Abrams designed after the release of *[8](Super)(Super 8 (2011 film))* (2011), the prize for answering a series of questions would be walk-on roles for two people in *Into Darkness*. He debuted three frames of the film on *[Conan](Conan (talk show))* on October 4, 2012, showing what he described as Spock \"in a volcano, in this crazy suit\". The official poster for the film was released two months later on December 3, 2012, showing a mysterious figure (thought to be Benedict Cumberbatch\\'s villain) standing on a pile of burning rubble looking over what appears to be a damaged [London](London); he is standing in a hole in the shape of the Starfleet insignia, blown out of the side of a building.\\n\\nAbout nine minutes of the opening sequence was shown before [IMAX](IMAX) presentations of *[Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey](The)(The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey)*, which was released in the United States on December 14, 2012. Alice Eve, Cumberbatch, and Burk unveiled the IMAX prologue in London, England on December 14. A two-minute teaser was released in iTunes Movie Trailers on December 17. The teaser marked the beginning of a [marketing](viral)(viral marketing) campaign, with a hidden link directing fans to a movie-related website. A 30-second teaser premiered February 3, 2013 during the stadium blackout of [Bowl XLVII](Super)(Super Bowl XLVII). The same day, Paramount released apps for Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone which enabled users to unlock tickets for showtimes two days before the film\\'s release date.\\n\\nAn international trailer was released on March 21, 2013, with an embedded URL revealing an online-only international poster. On April 8, Paramount released the final international one-sheet featuring solely Benedict Cumberbatch\\'s character.\\n\\nOn April 12, 2013, iTunes Movie Trailers revealed the final domestic [one-sheet](One sheet#Cinema) featuring USS *Enterprise*, and announced that the final US domestic trailer would be released on April 16. In the days leading up to the trailer release, character posters featuring Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and Harrison were released on iTunes.\\n\\nParamount attempted to broaden the film\\'s appeal to international audiences, an area where *Star Trek* and other science-fiction films had generally performed poorly. *Into Darkness* was dedicated to post-9/11 veterans. J.J. Abrams is connected with [Mission Continues](The)(The Mission Continues), and a section of the film\\'s website is dedicated to that organization.\\n\\n### Promotional tours\\n\\nThe cast (except for [Yelchin](Anton)(Anton Yelchin), [Greenwood](Bruce)(Bruce Greenwood), and [Weller](Peter)(Peter Weller)) participated in May 2013 press junkets. On May 7, Pegg appeared on *[Kimmel Live!](Jimmy)(Jimmy Kimmel Live!)*. On May 8, Quinto was interviewed on *[Night with Jimmy Fallon](Late)(Late Night with Jimmy Fallon)*. He was followed on May 10 by Cumberbatch (who told Fallon that his fans are called \"Cumberbitches\"; Fallon countered that his are called \"FalPals\") and on May 17 by Saldana. Saldana said that she lobbied Abrams for four years: \"If we make a sequel, Uhura needs to kick ass\". On May 9, Cumberbatch appeared on the *[Show with David Letterman](Late)(Late Show with David Letterman)*.\\n\\nOn May 10, Cho, Pegg, and Eve had a radio interview on *[Bob Rivers Show](The)(The Bob Rivers Show)*. They discussed approaching a body of work already mastered by an earlier generation of actors, agreeing that they would remain with the franchise as long as it lasted. That night, Chris Pine appeared on the *Late Show with David Letterman*; Letterman showed a gag reel of robots in a black-and-white film before showing a clip from *Into Darkness*. Pine said that he had to gain weight for the role of Captain Kirk.\\n\\nOne story told by cast members during the promotion concerned an on-set prank initially devised by Pegg, which he later noted grew out of proportion. While filming at the [Ignition Facility](National)(National Ignition Facility), Pegg and Pine (with the crew\\'s help) tricked the arriving actors into believing there was \"ambient radiation\" at the location and they had to wear \"neutron cream\" to avoid being burned by it. Cumberbatch was tricked into signing a release (which was meant to give the joke away, but he signed it without reading it), while Urban and Cho were tricked into recording a [service announcement](public)(public service announcement) about the necessity for neutron cream.\\n\\nOn May 13, Abrams appeared on *[Daily Show with Jon Stewart](The)(The Daily Show)*, and on May 16, Pine appeared on *[Ellen DeGeneres Show](The)(The Ellen DeGeneres Show)*. On May 14, Abrams, Zachary Quinto, Pine, and Alice Eve appeared on *[Urgant Show](The)(Evening Urgant)* (Russian: Вечерний Ургант) in [Russia](Russia).\\n\\n## Release\\n\\n### Theatrical\\n\\n[[File:Star Trek Into Darkness Cast 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|right|upright|alt=Four young men in suits|Cast members at the film\\'s [Australia](Australia)n premiere in April 2013 (left to right: Karl Urban, Zachary Quinto, director J.J.

The film was released on May 9, 2013, in international markets and May 16, 2013, in the [States](United)(United States).\\n\\n### Home media\\n\\n*Star Trek Into Darkness* was released as a digital download on August 20, 2013. It was first released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray 3D in the United Kingdom on September 2 and in the United States and Canada on September 10. There is also a Special Limited Edition Blu-ray set available with a model on a stand of USS *Vengeance* as seen in this movie.\\n\\nIn North America, the release is split into various retailer exclusives. Retailer [Buy](Best)(Best Buy) has an exclusive Blu-ray edition with 30 minutes of additional content. Target\\'s Blu-ray edition also has 30 minutes of additional content that is different from Best Buy\\'s. Online retailer iTunes\\' version comes with audio commentary for the film not available in the retailer exclusives. A collection of deleted scenes is available exclusively via the [SmartGlass](Xbox)(Xbox SmartGlass) second-screen app paired with the [Video](Xbox)(Xbox Video) release of the film.\\n\\nThe split of the special features between various retailers has attracted criticism from fans. In particular, The Digital Bits\\' editor Bill Hunt remarked that \"taking fully half or more of the disc-based special features created for a major Blu-ray release and casting them to the winds as retailer exclusives, thus forcing your customers to go on an expensive scavenger hunt is, I\\'m sorry, absolutely outrageous. Seriously, if Paramount is going to treat its Blu-ray customers like this, they should just get out of the business altogether. Or better yet, farm all their titles out to third party licensees who will treat these films and Blu-ray customers in general with greater care and respect.\" Weeks after posting his article, Hunt himself was invited by Paramount to discuss about the issue of giving away the film\\'s special features to different retail partners. He suggested \"[putting] together the true special edition that should have been delivered from the start, with all of the extras that got scattered around to different retailers, including the enhanced audio commentary, plus all-new content just for this release... [and] to consider offering the IMAX version of the film...\"\\n\\n## Reception\\n\\n### Box office\\n\\n*Into Darkness* earned $13.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, lower than [Trek*](*Star)(Star Trek (film))\\'s $30.9 million. The film earned $21.6million the following Friday, also lower than its predecessor\\'s earnings four years earlier ($26million). It earned $70.6million during its opening weekend, finishing in the US box-office top spot (above *[Great Gatsby](The)(The Great Gatsby (2013 film))* and *[Man 3](Iron)(Iron Man 3)*). Total weekend earnings were $84.1million, including the early-showing grosses. Although these were lower than Paramount\\'s projected box-office earnings, studio vice-chairman [Moore](Rob)(Rob Moore (executive)) said he was \"extremely pleased\" with the sequel\\'s performance.\\n\\nSeveral weeks after release, the film grossed $147million at the foreign box office, surpassing the lifetime international earnings of its predecessor. *Into Darkness* reached the top spot of [China](China)\\'s box office with a $25.8million gross, tripling the overall earnings of the previous film during its opening weekend. *Star Trek Into Darkness* ended its North American theatrical run on September 12, 2013, with a box office total of $228,778,661, which places it as the 11th highest-grossing film for 2013. It earned $467,365,246 worldwide, ranking it in 14th place for 2013, and making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise.\\n\\nScott Mendelson of *[Forbes](Forbes)* contends that the film\\'s box office performance was the result of Paramount\\'s inability to sell the basic components of the film\\'s story, and inclusion of Khan \"for little reason other than marketability and then spent the next year or so lying to everyone and claiming said villain wasn\\'t in the picture[...] With no added value elements to sell, Paramount was forced to craft a generic campaign based around Benedict Cumberbatch as \"Generic Bad Guy\", so the excitement never took hold[...] This was adding to the idea that merely withholding basic story elements is tantamount to promising stunning plot twists[...] and it made fans and general moviegoers less excited about *Star Trek 2* than they were four, three, or even two years ago.\" Calculating in all expenses, *[Hollywood](Deadline)(Deadline Hollywood)* estimated that the film made a profit of $29.9 million.\\n\\n### Critical response\\n\\nOn [Tomatoes](Rotten)(Rotten Tomatoes) the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 297 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site\\'s consensus reads, \"Visually spectacular and suitably action packed, *Star Trek Into Darkness* is a rock-solid installment in the venerable sci-fi franchise, even if it\\'s not as fresh as its predecessor.\" On [Metacritic](Metacritic) the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by [CinemaScore](CinemaScore) gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\\n\\nCritics called it a \"rousing adventure\" and \"a riveting action-adventure in space\". Cumberbatch\\'s performance attracted praise from critics, with Peter Travers of *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone)* calling it a \"tour de force to reckon with\" and his character \"a villain for the ages\". Joe Neumaier of the New York *[News](Daily)(Daily News (New York))* wrote that Cumberbatch delivered \"one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory\". Jonathan Romney of *[Independent](The)(The Independent)* noted Cumberbatch\\'s voice, saying it was \"so sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of [McKellen](Ian)(Ian McKellen), [Stewart](Patrick)(Patrick Stewart), and [Rickman](Alan)(Alan Rickman) holding an elocution contest down a well\". *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)* praised his screen presence: \"He fuses Byronic charisma with an impatient, imperious intelligence that seems to raise the ambient I.Q. whenever he\\'s on screen\".\\n\\nHowever, not all of the reviews were positive; *The Independent* said the film would \"underwhelm even the Trekkies\". [Lumenick](Lou)(Lou Lumenick) of the *[York Post](New)(New York Post)* gave the film one-and-a-half stars (out of four), saying it had a \"limp plot\" and the \"special effects are surprisingly cheesy for a big-budget event movie\". A.O. Scott dismissed the film in *The New York Times*: \"It\\'s uninspired hackwork, and the frequent appearance of blue lens flares does not make this movie any more of a personal statement\". [Meyer](Nicholas)(Nicholas Meyer), director of *Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan* (from which the film borrows and remakes some scenes), revealed in 2018 that he had been disappointed with the film. He was quoted as saying: \"In my sort of artistic worldview, if you\\'re going to do an homage, you have to add something. You have to put another layer on it, and they didn\\'t. Just by putting the same words in different characters\\' mouths didn\\'t add up to anything, and if you have someone dying in one scene and sort of being resurrected immediately after, there\\'s no real drama going on. It just becomes a gimmick or gimmicky, and that\\'s what I found it to be, ultimately.\"\\n\\nThe film was criticized for a scene with actress [Eve](Alice)(Alice Eve)\\'s character Carol Marcus in her underwear, which was called \"wholly unnecessary\" and \"gratuitous\". Screenwriter and producer Damon Lindelof apologized on [Twitter](Twitter) for the scene: \"I take responsibility and will be more mindful in the future\". On *[Conan](Conan (talk show))*, Abrams addressed the matter by debuting a deleted scene of actor [Cumberbatch](Benedict)(Benedict Cumberbatch)\\'s character Khan taking a shower. Eve addressed the underwear controversy at a 2013 Las Vegas *Star Trek* Convention and said, \"I didn\\'t know it would cause such a ruckus. I didn\\'t feel exploited.\"StarTrek.com staff.

Retrieved October 30, 2013.\\n\\n|width=35%|align=right}}\\n\\nDespite an acclaimed performance from Cumberbatch, Christian Blauvelt of Hollywood.com criticized the casting of the actor as [Noonien Singh](Khan)(Khan Noonien Singh), saying that the character had been \"whitewashed into oblivion\", since Khan is an explicitly non-white character in the [Trek* canon](*Star)(Star Trek canon) (introduced as a [Sikh](Sikh) and former ruler of much of eastern Eurasia). There have been similar accusations of [whitewashing](whitewashing in film) by fans and American Sikhs, with *[Trek: Voyager](Star)(Star Trek: Voyager)* actor [Wang](Garrett)(Garrett Wang) tweeting \"The casting of Cumberbatch was a mistake on the part of the producers. I am not being critical of the actor or his talent, just the casting\". [Takei](George)(George Takei), the original Hikaru Sulu, was also disappointed with the casting, as he thought it would have been better to cast Cumberbatch not as an established villain like Khan but as a new character. On Trekmovie.com, co-producer and co-screenwriter Bob Orci addressed Khan\\'s casting: \"Basically, as we went through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within , not some other race\". An in-canon comic book has subsequently been created to [retcon](retcon) Khan\\'s hitherto unexplained change in ethnicity in the film.\\n\\nIn an interview with [Buzzfeed](BuzzFeed) two years after the film\\'s release, Abrams addressed some of the film\\'s shortcomings. He thought that the dynamic for Kirk and Spock\\'s relationship in the film \"wasn\\'t really clear.\" For keeping the identity of Khan a secret prior to the film\\'s release, Abrams felt he \"was trying to preserve the fun for the audience, and not just tell them something that the characters don\\'t learn for 45 minutes into the movie, so the audience wouldn\\'t be so ahead of it.\" In the end, Abrams recognized that \"there were certain things I was unsure of[...] Any movie[...] has a fundamental conversation happening during it. And [*Into Darkness*,](for) I didn\\'t have it[...] [problems with the plot](The) was not anyone\\'s fault but mine, or, frankly, anyone\\'s problem but mine. [script](The) was a little bit of a collection of scenes that were written by my friends[...] And yet, I found myself frustrated by my choices, and unable to hang my hat on an undeniable thread of the main story. So then I found myself on that movie basically tap-dancing as well as I could to try and make the sequences as entertaining as possible[...] I would never say that I don\\'t think that the movie ended up working. But I feel like it didn\\'t work as well as it could have had I made some better decisions before we started shooting.\"\\n\\n### Accolades\\n\\nList of accolades received by *Star Trek Into Darkness*}}\\n\\n## Sequel\\n\\n*Star Trek Beyond*}}\\n\\n*Into Darkness* received a sequel, *Beyond* in July 2016.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n* [*Star Trek Into Darkness* controversy](Wikipedia)(Wikipedia Star Trek Into Darkness controversy)\\n\\n* [Trek* film series](*Star)(Star Trek (film series))\\n\\n* [of adventure films of the 2010s](List)(List of adventure films of the 2010s)\\n\\n* [of films featuring extraterrestrials](List)(List of films featuring extraterrestrials)\\n\\n* [of science fiction films of the 2010s](List)(List of science fiction films of the 2010s)\\n\\n* [in film](Whitewashing)(Whitewashing in film)\\n\\n## References\\n\\n## External links\\n\\n*\\n\\n* [Official database website](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-into-darkness)\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n}}\\n\\n[films](Category:2013)(Category:2013 films)\\n\\n[English-language films](Category:2010s)(Category:2010s English-language films)\\n\\n[3D films](Category:2013)(Category:2013 3D films)\\n\\n[science fiction action films](Category:2013)(Category:2013 science fiction action films)\\n\\n[science fiction adventure films](Category:2010s)(Category:2010s science fiction adventure films)\\n\\n[science fiction action films](Category:American)(Category:American science fiction action films)\\n\\n[science fiction adventure films](Category:American)(Category:American science fiction adventure films)\\n\\n[sequel films](Category:American)(Category:American sequel films)\\n\\n[about cryonics](Category:Fiction)(Category:Fiction about cryonics)\\n\\n[about interracial romance](Category:Films)(Category:Films about interracial romance)\\n\\n[about terrorism in Europe](Category:Films)(Category:Films about terrorism in Europe)\\n\\n[set in the 23rd century](Category:Films)(Category:Films set in the 23rd century)\\n\\n[set in the future](Category:Films)(Category:Films set in the future)\\n\\n[set in London](Category:Films)(Category:Films set in London)\\n\\n[set in San Francisco](Category:Films)(Category:Films set in San Francisco)\\n\\n[shot in Iceland](Category:Films)(Category:Films shot in Iceland)\\n\\n[shot in Los Angeles](Category:Films)(Category:Films shot in Los Angeles)\\n\\n[films](Category:IMAX)(Category:IMAX films)\\n\\n[Darkness](Into)(Category:Star Trek (film franchise))\\n\\n[Robot Productions films](Category:Bad)(Category:Bad Robot Productions films)\\n\\n[Media films](Category:Skydance)(Category:Skydance Media films)\\n\\n[Pictures films](Category:Paramount)(Category:Paramount Pictures films)\\n\\n[scored by Michael Giacchino](Category:Films)(Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino)\\n\\n[directed by J.

       "  'answer': '**Star Trek Into Darkness** is a 2013 science fiction action film directed by J.J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof. Serving as the twelfth installment in the Star Trek franchise and a sequel to the 2009 reboot, the film follows Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), and the crew of the USS Enterprise as they pursue a rogue former Starfleet agent, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is later revealed to be Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically-engineered superhuman. The story explores themes of vengeance, leadership, and the moral boundaries of justice, as Kirk and his crew are drawn into a conspiracy that threatens to ignite war with the Klingon Empire. The film stands out for its high-stakes plot, visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic, and a cast that includes returning members from the previous film, as well as new additions like Alice Eve and Peter Weller.\\n\\nThe production of *Into Darkness* involved significant planning and challenges, including script development delays, debates over the main antagonist, and decisions regarding the use of 3D and IMAX filming techniques. The film was shot in various locations, including Los Angeles and Iceland, and featured music composed by Michael Giacchino. The filmmakers aimed to both honor the legacy of Star Trek and appeal to modern audiences, incorporating nods to classic installments such as \"The Wrath of Khan.\" The marketing campaign was extensive, employing viral marketing, international promotional tours, and strategic releases of trailers and posters to build anticipation worldwide. Notably, the film’s title choice and the decision to forgo numerical labeling reflected a desire to distinguish the rebooted series from earlier entries.\\n\\nUpon its release, *Star Trek Into Darkness* achieved commercial success, grossing over $467 million globally and becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise. It received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for its visual spectacle and Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance as Khan, though some critics and fans expressed disappointment with the plot’s reliance on homage, perceived lack of originality, and the controversial casting of Khan. The film sparked discussions about whitewashing, character development, and marketing transparency. Despite these controversies, it earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and was followed by the sequel *Star Trek Beyond* in 2016.',\n",

In need of a GS,  Kim Sa-bu offers him the position of residency at Doldam Hospital but in reality, it was Seo Woo-Jin\\'s professor and Teacher Kim\\'s senior who informs Kim Sa-bu about Seo Woo Jin\\'s exemplary skills as a surgeon but his lack of opportunities. Initially because of the dire need for money, he accepts Teacher Kim\\'s job offer but in the long run and his constant association with Kim Sa-bu, he realizes his worth as a doctor and the profession and starts admiring Teacher Kim who was the only one who was considerate to him when the whole world stood against him.

       "  'answer': \"**Dr. Romantic** is a popular South Korean medical drama series that first aired in 2016 on SBS and has since released three seasons, with the third beginning in 2023. The series centers around Boo Yong-joo, also known as Kim Sa-bu (played by Han Suk-kyu), a legendary triple-board certified surgeon who, after a traumatic incident at a prestigious Seoul hospital, retreats to the small, rural Doldam Hospital. There, he becomes a mentor to young doctors, including Kang Dong-joo (Yoo Yeon-seok) and Yoon Seo-jung (Seo Hyun-jin), teaching them to prioritize patients over power and prestige. Over the seasons, the hospital staff evolves, but Kim Sa-bu’s mission of nurturing ethical, skilled doctors and creating a hospital that serves all in need remains at the series' heart.\\n\\nEach season introduces new characters and challenges. In Season 2, Kim Sa-bu recruits Seo Woo-jin (Ahn Hyo-seop), a talented but troubled surgeon ostracized for his whistleblowing, and Cha Eun-jae (Lee Sung-kyung), a gifted doctor struggling with surgical anxiety. Together with the Doldam team, they face medical emergencies, ethical dilemmas, and institutional politics, while Park Min-gook (Kim Joo-hun) is introduced as a rival-turned-ally. By Season 3, Doldam Hospital opens a Regional Trauma Center, expanding the scale and complexity of the cases and reuniting some original characters, including Kang Dong-joo, to tackle new medical crises and hospital politics.\\n\\nThe series is lauded for its compelling narratives, strong character development, and Han Suk-kyu’s acclaimed performance as Kim Sa-bu. It blends medical drama with themes of mentorship, redemption, and the struggle against systemic corruption, achieving high viewership ratings and critical praise, especially for its first season. The show also features an ensemble cast, memorable supporting characters, and original soundtracks by popular Korean artists, contributing to its lasting popularity both domestically and internationally through streaming platforms like Disney+, Kocowa, Viki, and Viu.\",\n",

       "  'answer': \"Nusrat Jahan Choudhury, born in Chicago in 1976 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, is an accomplished American lawyer poised to become a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York. Choudhury holds a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University, a Master of Public Administration from Princeton University, and a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School. Her early legal career included clerkships with Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York and Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. For over a decade, she served in various roles at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), focusing on national security and racial justice, and is currently the legal director of the ACLU of Illinois.\\n\\nChoudhury's nomination to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in January 2022 was notable both for her professional background and for its historical significance—upon confirmation, she will be the first Muslim woman and first Bangladeshi American to serve as a federal judge. Her confirmation process was contentious, particularly after questions arose during her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing regarding past statements about police violence. Several law enforcement organizations opposed her nomination, and conflicting testimony led to further scrutiny from Senate Republicans. Despite this, her nomination advanced through committee and was ultimately confirmed in June 2023 by a narrow 50–49 Senate vote, with Senator Joe Manchin citing concerns about her impartiality as the reason for his opposition.\\n\\nOn a personal note, Choudhury’s background is rooted in her family's immigrant experience—her father came to the United States as a Fulbright scholar and worked as a physician in Chicago for four decades. She married Michael Early, a visual effects producer, in 2016. Choudhury’s appointment is seen as a groundbreaking moment for representation in the federal judiciary, reflecting both her professional achievements and her significance as a trailblazer for Muslim and Bangladeshi Americans in the legal field.\",\n",

Elias Sanders immigrated to the United States in 1921 and became a paint salesman.New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957 immigration record: Eliasz Gitman, sailing from Antwerp, mother Jetti Gutman, citizenship in 1927 as Elias Sanders. Bernie\\'s mother, Dorothy Sanders () (1912–1960), was born in New York City. He is the younger brother of [Sanders](Larry)(Larry Sanders (politician)).\\n\\nSanders says he became interested in politics at an early age due to his family background.\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*  In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the [Holocaust](Holocaust).\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nSanders lived in [Brooklyn](Midwood,)(Midwood, Brooklyn). He attended elementary school at [197](P.S.)(P.S. 197), where he won a borough championship on the basketball team. He attended [school](Hebrew)(Hebrew school) in the afternoons, and celebrated his [mitzvah](bar)(bar mitzvah) in 1954. His older brother [Larry](Larry Sanders (politician)) said that during their childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major purchases, \"like curtains or a rug\", were not affordable. }}\\n\\nSanders attended [Madison High School](James)(James Madison High School (Brooklyn)), where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race. In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last of three candidates for the student body presidency with a campaign that focused on aiding [War](Korean)(Korean War) orphans. Despite the loss, he became active in his school\\'s fundraising activities for Korean orphans, including organizing a charity basketball game. Sanders attended high school with economist [Block](Walter)(Walter Block). When he was 19, his mother died at age 46. His father died two years later in 1962 at age 57.\\n\\nSanders studied at [College](Brooklyn)(Brooklyn College) for a year in 1959–1960 before transferring to the [of Chicago](University)(University of Chicago) and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964. In later interviews, Sanders described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was \"boring and irrelevant\", and said he viewed community activism as more important to his education.\\n\\n## Early career\\n\\n### Political activism\\n\\nSanders later described his time in Chicago as \"the major period of intellectual ferment in my life.\" While there, he joined the [People\\'s Socialist League](Young)(Young People\\'s Socialist League (1907)) (the youth affiliate of the [Party of America](Socialist)(Socialist Party of America)) and was active in the [rights movement](civil)(civil rights movement) as a student for the [of Racial Equality](Congress)(Congress of Racial Equality) (CORE) and the [Nonviolent Coordinating Committee](Student)(Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) (SNCC). Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC. In January 1962, he went to a rally at the [of Chicago](University)(University of Chicago) administration building to protest university president [Wells Beadle](George)(George Wells Beadle)\\'s [campus housing policy](segregated)(Housing segregation in the United States). At the protest, Sanders said, \"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments\". He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president\\'s office. After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. After further protests, the University of Chicago ended racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.\\n\\n[Mahoney](Joan)(Joan Mahoney), a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as \"a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn\\'t terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn\\'t agree with.\" Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting [brutality](police)(police brutality), only to notice later that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down. He attended the 1963 [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](March)(March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom), where [Luther King Jr.](Martin)(Martin Luther King Jr.) gave the \"[Have a Dream](I)(I Have a Dream)\" speech. That summer, Sanders was fined $25 () for resisting arrest during a demonstration in [Englewood](Englewood, Chicago) against [segregation](Racial segregation in the United States) in Chicago\\'s public schools.\\n\\nIn addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s, Sanders was active in several [and antiwar movements](peace)(Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War) while attending the University of Chicago, becoming a member of the [Peace Union](Student)(Student Peace Union). He applied for [objector](conscientious)(conscientious objector) status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be [drafted](Conscription in the United States). Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it, and has strongly supported [benefits](veterans\\')(veterans\\' benefits) throughout his political career. He also was briefly an organizer with the [Packinghouse Workers of America](United)(United Packinghouse Workers of America) while in Chicago. He also worked on the reelection campaign of [Despres](Leon)(Leon Despres), a prominent Chicago alderman who opposed then-mayor [J. Daley](Richard)(Richard J.

Sanders said that he spent much of his student years reading history, sociology, psychology, and the works of political authors, from [Jefferson](Thomas)(Thomas Jefferson), [Lincoln](Abraham)(Abraham Lincoln), [Dewey](John)(John Dewey), [Marx](Karl)(Karl Marx), and [Fromm](Erich)(Erich Fromm)—\"reading everything except what I was supposed to read for class the next day.\"\\n\\n### Professional history and early years in Vermont\\n\\nAfter graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he worked various jobs, including Head Start teacher, [psychiatric](psychiatrist) aide, and carpenter. In 1968, he moved to [Vermont](Stannard,)(Stannard, Vermont), a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the [census](1970)(1970 census)) within Vermont\\'s rural [Kingdom](Northeast)(Northeast Kingdom) region, because he had been \"captivated by rural life\". While there, he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, and writer who created and sold \"radical film strips\" and other educational materials to schools. He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication *The Vermont Freeman*. He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous [County](Chittenden)(Chittenden County, Vermont) in the mid-1970s. During his [2018](2018 United States Senate election in Vermont) reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates.\\n\\n### Liberty Union campaigns\\n\\nSanders began his electoral political career in 1971 as a member of the [Union Party](Liberty)(Liberty Union Party), a national umbrella party for various socialist-oriented state parties, originating in the [anti-war](Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War) movement and the [Party](People\\'s)(People\\'s Party (United States, 1971)). He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate in the special election for U.S. senator in 1972 and in the general election in 1974. In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 33-year-old [County](Chittenden)(Chittenden County, Vermont) state\\'s attorney [Leahy](Patrick)(Patrick Leahy) ([D](Democratic Party (United States)); 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative [Mallary](Dick)(Dick Mallary) ([R](Republican Party (United States)); 66,223 votes; 46%).\\n\\nThe 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union\\'s influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party. His strong performance forced the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the [Republican](Republican Party (United States)) or [Democratic](Democratic Party (United States)) candidate for those offices from garnering a majority of votes. The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty Union, however, and in October 1977, less than a year after the 1976 campaign concluded, he and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party. During the [presidential election](1980)(1980 United States presidential election), Sanders served as one of three electors for the [Workers Party](Socialist)(Socialist Workers Party (United States)) in Vermont.\\n\\nAfter his resignation from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People\\'s Historical Society (APHS). While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader [V. Debs](Eugene)(Eugene V. Debs), who ran for president five times as the Socialist Party candidate.\\n\\n## Mayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981–1989)\\n\\n[[Hall Burlington Vermont from southeast on Main Street.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Burlington City Hall](File:City)]\\n\\n### Campaigns\\n\\nOn November 8, 1980, Sanders announced his candidacy for mayor. He formally announced his campaign on December 16 at a City Hall press conference. Sanders selected Linda Niedweske as his campaign manager. The [Party](Citizens)(Citizens Party (United States)) attempted to nominate Greg Guma for mayor, but Guma declined, saying it would be \"difficult to run against another progressive candidate\". Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by his close friend [Sugarman](Richard)(Richard Sugarman), an Orthodox Jewish professor of religious studies at the [of Vermont](University)(University of Vermont), who had shown him a ward-by-ward breakdown of the [Vermont gubernatorial election](1976)(1976 Vermont gubernatorial election), in which Sanders had run, that showed him receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide.\\n\\nSanders initially won the mayoral election by 22 votes against Paquette, Bove, and McGrath, but the margin was later reduced to 10 votes. Paquette did not contest the results of the recount.\\n\\nPaquette\\'s loss was attributed to his own shortcomings, as he did not campaign or promote his candidacy since both Sanders and Independent candidate Richard Bove were not seen as a serious challengers, as Sanders had not previously won an election. Paquette was also considered to have lost because he proposed an unpopular $0.65 per $100 raise in taxes that Sanders opposed. Sanders spent around $4,000 on his campaign.\\n\\nSanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The result shocked the local political establishment.\\n\\nSanders formed a coalition between independents and the Citizens Party. On December 3, 1982, he announced that he would seek reelection. On January 22, 1983, the Citizens Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders, although Sanders ran as an independent. He was reelected, defeating [Stephany](Judy)(Judy Stephany) and James Gilson.\\n\\nSanders initially considered not seeking a third term, but announced on December 5, 1984, that he would run. He formally launched his campaign on December 7, and was reelected. On December 1, 1986, Sanders, who had finished third in the [Vermont gubernatorial election](1986)(1986 Vermont gubernatorial election), announced that he would seek reelection to a fourth term as mayor of Burlington, despite close associates stating that he was tired of being mayor. Sanders defeated Democratic nominee Paul Lafayette in the election. He said he would not seek another mayoral term after the 1987 election: \"eight years is enough and I think it is time for new leadership, which does exist within the coalition, to come up\".\\n\\nSanders did not run for a fifth term as mayor. He went on to lecture in political science at [Kennedy School](Harvard)(Harvard Kennedy School) that year and at [College](Hamilton)(Hamilton College) in 1991.\\n\\n### Administration\\n\\nDuring his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a [socialist](socialist) and was so described in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first [Party](Citizens)(Citizens Party (United States)) city councilor [Bouricius](Terry)(Terry Bouricius), formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the [Progressive Party](Vermont)(Vermont Progressive Party). The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders\\'s vetoes. Under his leadership, Burlington balanced its city budget; attracted a minor league baseball team, the [Reds](Vermont)(Vermont Reds), then the [Double-A](Double-A (baseball)) affiliate of the [Reds](Cincinnati)(Cincinnati Reds); became the first U.S. city to fund [housing](community-trust)(community land trust); and successfully sued the local [television](cable)(Cable television in the United States) franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.\\n\\nAs mayor, Sanders also led extensive [revitalization](downtown)(urban renewal) projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington\\'s [Champlain](Lake)(Lake Champlain) waterfront. In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial waterfront property owned by the [Vermont Railway](Central)(Central Vermont Railway) into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices. He ran under the slogan \"Burlington is not for sale\" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a [mixed-use](mixed-use) district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.\\n\\nSanders was a consistent [of U.S. foreign policy](critic)(Criticism of United States foreign policy) in [America](Latin)(Latin America) throughout the 1980s. In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by [Chomsky](Noam)(Noam Chomsky). In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as \"a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America\" and said that he was \"delighted to welcome a person who I think we\\'re all very proud of.\"\\n\\nSanders hosted and produced a [television](public-access)(public-access television) program, *Bernie Speaks with the Community*, from 1986 to 1988. He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, *[Shall Overcome](We)(We Shall Overcome (Bernie Sanders album))*, in 1987. That same year, *[News & World Report](U.S.)(U.S. News & World Report)* ranked Sanders one of America\\'s best mayors. The American Presidency Project|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=February 18, 2020}} , Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.\\n\\nWhen Sanders left office in 1989, Bouricius, a member of the Burlington city council, said that Sanders had \"changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont\".\\n\\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1991–2007)\\n\\n[[Sanders 104th Congress.jpg|thumb|upright|Sanders\\' first congressional portrait photograph, 1991](File:Bernie)]\\n\\n### Elections\\n\\nIn 1988, incumbent Republican congressman [Jeffords](Jim)(Jim Jeffords) decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing [at-large congressional district](Vermont\\'s)(Vermont\\'s at-large congressional district). Former [Governor](Lieutenant)(Lieutenant Governor of Vermont) [P. Smith](Peter)(Peter P. Smith) won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic state representative [N. Poirier](Paul)(Paul N. Poirier) placed third with 19%. Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.\\n\\nSanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since [Reams](Frazier)(Frazier Reams) of [Ohio](Ohio) won his second term in 1952, as well as the first socialist elected to the House since [Marcantonio](Vito)(Vito Marcantonio), from the [Labor Party](American)(American Labor Party), who won his last term in 1948. Sanders served as a representative from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 [Revolution](Republican)(Republican Revolution), when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.\\n\\n### Legislation\\n\\n[[Bernie Sanders.jpg|thumb|Sanders at an NBC press conference, February 1991](File:Rep.)]\\n\\n[[File:Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders 1993 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Sanders meeting in 1993 with Hillary Clinton to discuss [plan](her)(Clinton health care plan of 1993) to reform the healthcare system]]\\n\\nDuring his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as [primarily on behalf of the wealthy](working)(Corporatocracy). In 1991, he co-founded the [Progressive Caucus](Congressional)(Congressional Progressive Caucus), a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years, while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.\\n\\nIn 2005, *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone)* called Sanders the \"amendment king\" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Being an independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.\\n\\n#### Banking reform\\n\\nIn 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the [legislation](Glass–Steagall)(Glass–Steagall legislation) provisions that kept [banks](investment)(investment banks) and commercial banks separate entities. He was a vocal critic of [Reserve Chair](Federal)(Chair of the Federal Reserve) [Greenspan](Alan)(Alan Greenspan); in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion, Sanders told him he was concerned that he was \"way out of touch\" and \"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations.\"\\n\\n#### Cancer registries\\n\\nConcerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish [registries](cancer)(cancer registry) to collect data on cancer. Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President [H. W. Bush](George)(George H. W. Bush) on October 24, 1992.\\n\\n#### Firearms and criminal justice\\n\\nIn 1993, Sanders voted against the [Bill](Brady)(Brady Bill), which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238–187. He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.\\n\\nSanders did vote for other gun-control measures. For example, in 1994, he voted for the [Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act](Violent)(Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act) \"because it included the [Against Women Act](Violence)(Violence Against Women Act) and the ban on certain assault weapons.\" He was nevertheless critical of the other parts of the bill. Although he acknowledged that \"clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and [sociopathic](antisocial personality disorder), and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them\", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in \"dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence\" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, \"we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.\"\\n\\nSanders has at times favored stronger law enforcement and sentencing. In 1996, he voted against a bill that would have prohibited police from purchasing tanks and armored carriers. In 1998, he voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possessing a gun while committing a federal crime to ten years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as [marijuana](marijuana) possession.\\n\\nIn 2005, Sanders voted for the [of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act](Protection)(Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act). The purpose of the act was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. , he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.\\n\\n#### Opposition to the Patriot Act\\n\\nSanders was a consistent critic of the [Act](Patriot)(Patriot Act). As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357–66 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects and voted against each reauthorization. In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals\\' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November4 of that year in House–Senate negotiations and never became law.\\n\\n#### Opposition to the War in Iraq\\n\\n[[Sanders at Milton High School - Milton, Vermont.jpg|thumb|Sanders meeting with students at Milton High School in Milton, Vermont, 2004](File:Bernie)]\\n\\nSanders voted against the [resolutions](Iraq Resolution) authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the [invasion of Iraq](2003)(2003 invasion of Iraq). He voted for the 2001 [for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists](Authorization)(Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. He especially opposed the [administration](Bush)(Presidency of George W. Bush)\\'s decision to start a war unilaterally.\\n\\n#### Trade policy\\n\\nIn February 2005, Sanders introduced a bill that would have withdrawn the [normal trade relations](permanent)(permanent normal trade relations) (PNTR) status that had been extended to China in October 2000. He said to the House, \"Anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that it is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled\", citing the American jobs being lost to overseas competitors. His bill received 71 co-sponsors but was not sent to the floor for a vote.\\n\\n## U.S. Senate (2007–present)\\n\\n[[Sanders.jpg|thumb|200px|Senate portrait, 2007](File:Bernie)]\\n\\n### Elections\\n\\n#### 2006\\n\\nSanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator [Jeffords](Jim)(Jim Jeffords) announced that he would not seek a fourth term. [Schumer](Chuck)(Chuck Schumer), chair of the [Senatorial Campaign Committee](Democratic)(Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee) and fellow [Madison High School](James)(James Madison High School (Brooklyn)) alumnus, endorsed Sanders. This was a critical move because it meant no Democrat running against him could expect financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by [Minority Leader](Senate)(Party leaders of the United States Senate) [Reid](Harry)(Harry Reid) and [National Committee](Democratic)(Democratic National Committee) chair and former Vermont governor [Dean](Howard)(Howard Dean). Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who \"votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.\" Then-Senator [Obama](Barack)(Barack Obama) also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006. Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.\\n\\n[[Sanders January 2013.jpg|thumb|Sanders being sworn in for his second term in 2013 by Joe Biden](File:Bernie)]\\n\\nIn the most expensive political campaign in Vermont\\'s history, Sanders defeated businessman [Tarrant](Rich)(Rich Tarrant) by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected him as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in.\\n\\n#### 2012\\n\\nSanders was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote.\\n\\n#### 2018\\n\\nSanders was reelected in 2018 with 67% of the vote.\\n\\n### Legislation\\n\\nWhile a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions. Of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law. While he has consistently advocated for progressive causes, *[Politico](Politico)* wrote that he has \"rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.\" According to *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)*, \"Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate&nbsp;... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.\" During his time in the Senate, he had lower legislative effectiveness than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made. Nevertheless, he has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills, many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100&nbsp;million in funding for community health centers; $10&nbsp;million for an outreach program for servicemembers who have [stress disorder](posttraumatic)(posttraumatic stress disorder), traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, and other mental disorders; a public database of senior [of Defense](Department)(United States Department of Defense) officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and including autism treatment under the military healthcare program [Tricare](Tricare).\\n\\nIn August 2022, Sanders voted for the [Reduction Act of 2022](Inflation)(Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). He was not satisfied with the bill, calling it only a small step forward.\\n\\n#### Finance and monetary policy\\n\\nIn 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the [Asset Relief Program](Troubled)(Troubled Asset Relief Program) (TARP), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall. On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace U.S. workers. The amendment passed and was added to the [Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009](American)(American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009). Among his proposed financial reforms is [the Federal Reserve](auditing)(Federal Reserve Transparency Act), which would reduce its independence in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that \"Audit the Fed\" legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders - full 2010-12-10 filibuster.webm|thumb|right|Sanders spoke for more than eight hours in his December 2010 [filibuster](filibuster).]]\\n\\nOn December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an 8 hour and 34 minute speech against the [Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010](Tax)(Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010),}} which proposed extending the [tax rates](Bush-era)(Bush-era tax rates). He argued that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. \"Enough is enough!&nbsp;... How many homes can you own?\" he asked. Nevertheless, the bill passed the Senate with a strong majority and was signed into law a week later. In February 2011, [Books](Nation)(Nation Books) published the speech as *[Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class](The)(The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class)*, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont [charitable organizations](nonprofit)(nonprofit organization).\\n\\nIn 2016, Sanders voted for the [Reserve Transparency Act](Federal)(Federal Reserve Transparency Act), which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.\\n\\n#### Foreign policy\\n\\nOn June 12, 2017, U.S. senators agreed to legislation imposing [sanctions](new)(Countering America\\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) on [Russia](Russia) and [Iran](Iran). The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican [Paul](Rand)(Rand Paul). He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the [nuclear deal](Iran)(Iran nuclear deal).\\n\\nIn 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by Senators [Murphy](Chris)(Chris Murphy) ([D](Democratic Party (United States))–[CT](List of United States senators from Connecticut)) and [Lee](Mike)(Mike Lee) ([R](Republican Party (United States))–[UT](List of United States senators from Utah)) to invoke the [War Powers Resolution](1973)(War Powers Resolution) to end U.S. support for the [military intervention in Yemen](Saudi-led)(Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen), which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties and \"millions more suffering from starvation and disease\". After the [of Jamal Khashoggi](assassination)(assassination of Jamal Khashoggi) in October 2018 (which was ordered by Saudi Arabian [Prince](Crown)(Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia) [bin Salman](Mohammad)(Mohammad bin Salman), according to multiple intelligence agencies), his bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 56–41. The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247–175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying: \"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\"\\n\\n#### Health care\\n\\n[[File:Don\\'t Take Our Health Care Rally (35501942056).jpg|thumb|Don\\'t Take Our Health Care rally in [Ohio](Columbus,)(Columbus, Ohio), June 2017]]\\n\\nIn mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the [Care Act](Affordable)(Affordable Care Act) to fund $11&nbsp;billion to [health centers](community)(community health centers), especially those in [areas](rural)(Medical deserts in the United States). The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage. On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to [and replace the Affordable Care Act](repeal)(Efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), he predicted \"thousands of Americans would die\" from no longer having access to health care. [PolitiFact](PolitiFact) rated his statement \"mostly true\".\\n\\nIn September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a [healthcare](single-payer)(single-payer healthcare) plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill \"Berniecare\" and \"the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes.\" He responded that the Republican Party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32&nbsp;million Americans under the [Care Act](Affordable)(Affordable Care Act).\\n\\nAs chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders introduced legislation in 2013 to reauthorize and strengthen the [Americans Act](Older)(Older Americans Act), which supports [on Wheels](Meals)(Meals on Wheels) and other programs for seniors.\\n\\n#### Immigration policy\\n\\nIn 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers. In 2010, he supported the [Act](DREAM)(DREAM Act), which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors. In 2013, he supported the [of Eight](Gang)(Gang of Eight (immigration))\\'s comprehensive immigration reform bill after securing a $1.5&nbsp;billion youth jobs program provision, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.\\n\\n#### Income and wealth distribution\\n\\n[[File:Sanders Introduces $15 Minimum Wage.jpg|thumb|Sanders introduced legislation to [the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour](raise)(Fight for $15), April 2017]]\\n\\nIn April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the [wage](minimum)(Minimum wage in the United States) for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12 an hour proposal. On May 9, 2018, he introduced the [Democracy Act](Workplace)(Workplace Democracy Act), a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban [laws](right-to-work)(right-to-work laws) and some anti-union provisions of the [Act](Taft–Hartley)(Taft–Hartley Act), and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"\\n\\nSanders opposed the [United States federal budget](2018)(2018 United States federal budget) proposed by the [administration](Trump)(Presidency of Donald Trump), calling it \"a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country&nbsp;... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%.\"\\n\\nAfter the November 2017 revelations from the [Papers](Paradise)(Paradise Papers) and a recent report from the [for Policy Studies](Institute)(Institute for Policy Studies) which says just three people ([Bezos](Jeff)(Jeff Bezos), [Gates](Bill)(Bill Gates), and [Buffett](Warren)(Warren Buffett)) own more [wealth](Distribution of wealth) than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that \"we must end global [oligarchy](oligarchy)\" and that \"we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.\"\\n\\nOn September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with [Khanna](Ro)(Ro Khanna) to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop [BEZOS](Jeff Bezos)) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.\\n\\n#### Veterans affairs\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders talking to soldiers.jpg|thumb|Sanders speaking to members of the [Army National Guard](Vermont)(Vermont Army National Guard) sent to [D.C.](Washington,)(Washington, D.C.) as [preparations for the inauguration of Joe Biden](security)(security preparations for the inauguration of Joe Biden) in 2021]]\\n\\nOn June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the [Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014](Veterans\\')(Veterans\\' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014) to reform the [of Veterans Affairs](Department)(United States Department of Veterans Affairs) in the wake of the [Health Administration scandal of 2014](Veterans)(Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014). He worked with Senator [McCain](John)(John McCain), who co-sponsored the bill. His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Obama on August 7, 2014.\\n\\n### Supreme Court nominees\\n\\nOn March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support [Garland](Merrick)(Merrick Garland)\\'s nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, \"there are some more progressive judges out there.\" He opposed [Gorsuch](Neil)(Neil Gorsuch)\\'s nomination to the court, saying that Gorsuch had \"refused to answer legitimate questions\". He also objected to Senate Republicans\\' use of the [option](nuclear)(nuclear option) to \"choke off debate and ram [Gorsuch\\'s] nomination through the Senate\". He voted against Gorsuch\\'s confirmation as an [justice](associate)(Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States), and against Trump\\'s nominees [Kavanaugh](Brett)(Brett Kavanaugh) and [Coney Barrett](Amy)(Amy Coney Barrett). In 2022, Sanders voted to confirm Joe Biden\\'s [nominee](Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination) [Brown Jackson](Ketanji)(Ketanji Brown Jackson) to the Supreme Court.\\n\\n### Committee assignments\\n\\nAs an independent, Sanders maintains an agreement with the Senate Democratic leadership where he votes with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic [whip](Assistant Majority Leader), [Durbin](Dick)(Dick Durbin), agrees that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013–14 he was chairman of the [States Senate Committee on Veterans\\' Affairs](United)(United States Senate Committee on Veterans\\' Affairs) (during the [Health Administration scandal](Veterans)(Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014)).\\n\\nSanders became the [minority member](ranking)(Ranking member) on the [Budget Committee](Senate)(United States Senate Committee on the Budget) in 2015 and the chair in 2021; he previously chaired the [Veterans\\' Affairs Committee](Senate)(Senate Veterans\\' Affairs Committee) for two years. Since 2017, he has been chair of the [Democratic Outreach Committee](Senate)(United States Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee). He appointed economics professor [Kelton](Stephanie)(Stephanie Kelton), a [monetary theory](modern)(modern monetary theory) scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee\\'s Democratic minority and presented a report about helping \"rebuild the disappearing middle class\" that included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost [spending](infrastructure)(Infrastructure-based development), and increase [Security](Social)(Social Security (United States)) payments.\\n\\n, Sanders\\'s committee assignments are as follows:\\n\\n* [on the Budget](Committee)(United States Senate Committee on the Budget) (former chair)\\n\\n* [on Energy and Natural Resources](Committee)(United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources)\\n\\n** [on Energy](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on Energy)\\n\\n** [on National Parks](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on National Parks)\\n\\n** [on Water and Power](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on Water and Power)\\n\\n* [on Environment and Public Works](Committee)(United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works)\\n\\n** [on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety)\\n\\n** [on Green Jobs and the New Economy](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Green Jobs and the New Economy)\\n\\n** [on Transportation and Infrastructure](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure)\\n\\n* [on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions](Committee)(United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) (chair)\\n\\n** [on Children and Families](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Health Subcommittee on Children and Families)\\n\\n** [on Primary Health and Retirement Security](Subcommittee)(United States Senate Health Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security)\\n\\n* [on Veterans\\' Affairs](Committee)(United States Senate Committee on Veterans\\' Affairs) (former chair)\\n\\n### Caucus memberships\\n\\nSanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51–49 majority in the Senate during the [Congress](110th)(110th United States Congress) in 2007–08. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because [President](Vice)(Vice President of the United States) [Cheney](Dick)(Dick Cheney) would likely have broken potential [ties](List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States) in favor of the Republicans. He is a member of the following caucuses:\\n\\n* [Progressive Caucus](Congressional)(Congressional Progressive Caucus)\\n\\n* [Caucus of the United States Senate](Democratic)(Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate)\\n\\n* [States Senate Afterschool Caucus](United)(Afterschool Caucuses)\\n\\n### Approval ratings\\n\\nPolling conducted in August 2011 by [Policy Polling](Public)(Public Policy Polling) found that Sanders\\'s approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator. Both the [NAACP](NAACP) (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the [NHLA](National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate. In 2015, he was named one of the Top5 of *[Forward](The)(The Forward)* 50. In a November 2015 [Consult](Morning)(Morning Consult) poll, he reached an 83% approval rating among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator. [News](Fox)(Fox News) found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll. He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.\\n\\nIn April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among all the political figures included in the poll, a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.\\n\\n## 2016 presidential campaign\\n\\n[[Sanders rally in Portland, Oregon, August 2015 (20261929680).jpg|thumb|Sanders rally in Portland, Oregon, August 2015](File:Bernie)]\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders at Rutgers, May 2016.jpg|thumb|Sanders speaking at [University](Rutgers)(Rutgers University) in May 2016]]\\n\\nDuring the [Democratic presidential primaries](2012)(2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries), Sanders—dissatisfied with President Obama\\'s \"attempts to trade [Security](Social)(Social Security (United States)) cuts for tax hikes\"—reportedly considered running against him in the primaries. Sanders had previously suggested in 2011 that it was \"a good idea\" for someone to challenge Obama, and \"got so close to running a primary challenge&nbsp;... that Senator [Reid](Harry)(Harry Reid) had to intervene to stop him.\" In November 2013, Sanders suggested that Senator [Warren](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Warren) could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself. In December 2014, Warren said she was not running.\\n\\nSanders announced his intention to seek the [Party](Democratic)(Democratic Party (United States))\\'s nomination for president on April 30, 2015. [campaign](His)(Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016) was officially launched on May 26 in Burlington. In his announcement Sanders said, \"I don\\'t believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process\", and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.\\n\\nWarren welcomed Sanders\\'s entry into the race, saying, \"I\\'m glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be\", but never endorsed him.\\n\\nInitially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 [and caucuses](primaries)(Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016) and around 46% of pledged delegates to [Clinton](Hillary)(Hillary Clinton)\\'s 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters\\' enthusiasm, as well as for rejecting large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated [PAC](Super)(Super PAC). Some of the [National Committee](Democratic)(Democratic National Committee) (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.\\n\\nOn July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton [her unsuccessful general election campaign](in)(Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016) against [Republican](Republican Party (United States)) [Trump](Donald)(Donald Trump), while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun.\\n\\n### Campaign methods\\n\\nUnlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a [PAC](Super)(Super PAC) or from wealthy donors, instead focusing on small-dollar donations. His presidential campaign raised $1.5&nbsp;million within 24 hours of his official announcement. At the end of the year, the campaign had raised a total of $73&nbsp;million from more than one million people, making 2.5&nbsp;million donations, with an average donation of $27.16. The campaign reached 3.25&nbsp;million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20&nbsp;million in that month alone.\\n\\nSanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum, posting content to online platforms such as [Twitter](Twitter) and [Facebook](Facebook) and answering questions on [Reddit](Reddit). He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015, meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders Sign.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Sign at a 2015 Bernie Sanders rally at [Convention Center](Hynes)(Hynes Convention Center) in [MA](Boston,)(Boston, MA). ]]\\n\\nTo his surprise, Sanders\\'s June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds across the country.and surges in the polls |work=[Salon.com](Salon.com) |access-date=June 16, 2015 }} When Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in [Moines, Iowa](Des)(Des Moines, Iowa), he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made many stops around the state and Clinton\\'s visit was her first in 2015. On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in [Wisconsin](Madison,)(Madison, Wisconsin), drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000. Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in [Phoenix](Phoenix, Arizona); 15,000 in [Seattle](Seattle); and 28,000 in [Oregon](Portland,)(Portland, Oregon).\\n\\n### Presidential debates\\n\\nThe [National Committee](Democratic)(Democratic National Committee) (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC\\'s deliberate attempt to protect Clinton, who was perceived as the front-runner. In February 2016, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten. Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the [primary](California)(2016 California Democratic primary), citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election. Sanders expressed disappointment that Clinton canceled the debate before what he believed would be \"the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.\"\\n\\n### Polls and news coverage\\n\\nSome Sanders supporters raised concerns that publications such as *The New York Times* minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The *Times* [ombudsman](ombudsman) reviewed her paper\\'s coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that  the *Times* \"hasn\\'t always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate\\'s age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" She also found that the *Times* coverage of Sanders\\'s campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump\\'s, though Trump\\'s was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders\\'s. A December 2015 report found that the three major networks—[CBS](CBS), [NBC](NBC), and [ABC](American Broadcasting Company)—had spent 234 minutes reporting on Trump and 10 minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that *[World News Tonight](ABC)(ABC World News Tonight)* had spent 81 minutes on Trump and less than one minute on Sanders during 2015.\\n\\nA study of media coverage in the 2016 election concluded that while Sanders received less coverage than his rival Hillary Clinton, the amount of coverage of Sanders during the election was largely consistent with his polling performance, except during 2015 when Sanders received coverage that far exceeded his standing in the polls. Studies concluded that the tone of media coverage of Sanders was more favorable than that of any other candidate, whereas his main opponent in the democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, received the most negative coverage of any candidate. All 2016 candidates received vastly less media coverage than Donald Trump, and the Democratic primary received substantially less coverage than the Republican primary.\\n\\n[Goodman](Amy)(Amy Goodman) of *[Now!](Democracy)(Democracy Now!)* noted that on March 15, [Tuesday](Super)(Super Tuesday) III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, [Rubio](Marco)(Marko Rubio), and [Cruz](Ted)(Ted Cruz) were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast. However, political scientist [Bitecofer](Rachel)(Rachel Bitecofer) wrote in her 2018 book about the 2016 election that the Democratic primary was effectively over in terms of delegate count by mid-March 2016, but that the media promoted the narrative that the contest between Sanders and Clinton was \"heating up\" at that time.\\n\\nAn NBC/*Wall Street Journal* poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and Trump (by then the presumptive Republican nominee) in a \"dead heat\", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump. Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates ever polled, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating. Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders. A 2017 analysis in *Newsweek* found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, a lower proportion than that of Clinton supporters in [2008](2008 United States presidential election) who voted for [McCain](John)(John McCain).\\n\\n### DNC email leak\\n\\nIn July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee\\'s emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed making his irreligious tendencies a potential campaign issue in southern states and questioned his party loyalty. DNC chair [Wasserman Schultz](Debbie)(Debbie Wasserman Schultz) called his campaign manager \"an *ass*\" and \"a damn liar\". Speaking with [Tapper](Jake)(Jake Tapper) on [CNN](CNN), Sanders responded to the leak, saying, \"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates—to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"\\n\\n### Endorsement of Hillary Clinton\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders Nashua Oct 2016 - 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sanders campaigning for Hillary Clinton at [Community College](Nashua)(Nashua Community College) in October 2016]]\\n\\nAfter the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 12, Sanders formally [endorsed](List of Hillary Clinton presidential campaign political endorsements, 2016) Clinton. He said he would continue to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement progressive positions. Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention. He spoke at the [Democratic National Convention](2016)(2016 Democratic National Convention) on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton\\'s nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a [presidency](Trump)(Presidency of Donald Trump).\"\\n\\nOn November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in [Vermont](2016 United States presidential election in Vermont), even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a [write-in](Write-in candidate) [campaign](draft)(Draft (politics)) in American history. He also received more votes in Vermont than [Johnson](Gary)(Gary Johnson), the [Libertarian](Libertarian Party (United States)) candidate, and [Stein](Jill)(Jill Stein), the [Green](Green Party of the United States) candidate, combined. It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states, and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: [California](2016 United States presidential election in California), [Hampshire](New)(2016 United States presidential election in New Hampshire), and [Vermont](2016 United States presidential election in Vermont). In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.\\n\\n### Post-election activities\\n\\nIn November 2016, Sanders\\'s book *[Revolution: A Future to Believe In](Our)(Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In)* was released; upon its release, it was number three on [New York Times* Best Seller list](*The)(The New York Times Best Seller list). The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album. In February 2017, he began webcasting *The Bernie Sanders Show* on [live streaming](Facebook)(Facebook live). , guests had included [Barber](William)(William Barber II), [Fox](Josh)(Josh Fox), [Mayer](Jane)(Jane Mayer), and [Nye](Bill)(Bill Nye). Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.\\n\\nIn February 2018, Special Counsel [Mueller](Robert)(Robert Mueller)\\'s investigation into [interference in the 2016 U.S. elections](Russian)(Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections) concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton. Sanders rejected the investigation\\'s conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign. Furthermore, he blamed the Clinton campaign for not doing more to prevent Russian interference. He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign. *[Politico](Politico)* noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a [action committee](political)(political action committee) (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.\\n\\nIn November 2018, the [Institute](Sanders)(Sanders Institute) and [Varoufakis](Yanis)(Yanis Varoufakis), co-founder of [DiEM25](Democracy in Europe Movement 2025), launched [International](Progressive)(Progressive International), an international organization uniting [progressive](Progressivism) activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.\"\\n\\n### Influence on the Democratic Party\\n\\nAnalysts have suggested that Sanders\\'s campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party [leftward](politically)(Left-wing politics). A new [organization](political)(political action committee), [New Congress](Brand)(Brand New Congress), was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders. In August 2016, he formed [Revolution](Our)(Our Revolution), a [organization](political)(501(c)(4)) dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office. Speaking on the [Newshour](PBS)(PBS Newshour) about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, [Page](Susan)(Susan Page) described the Republican Party as \"Trump\\'s party\" and the Democratic Party as \"Bernie Sanders\\'s party\", saying that \"Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.\" Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced, an April 2018 opinion article in *[Week](The)(The Week)* suggested, \"Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.\" In July 2016, a *[Slate](Slate (magazine))* article called the Democratic platform draft \"a monument to his campaign\", noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage, but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a [tax](carbon)(carbon tax), Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a \"reasoned pathway for future legalization\" of marijuana.\\n\\nSanders\\'s presidential campaigns led to a resurgence of interest in [democracy](social)(social democracy) and [socialism](democratic)(democratic socialism) [millennials](among)(socialism among millennials).\\n\\n## 2020 presidential campaign\\n\\nOn February 19, 2019, Sanders announced that he would seek the Democratic Party\\'s 2020 nomination for president. He had declined the [Democratic Party](Vermont)(Vermont Democratic Party) nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party. On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a \"loyalty pledge\", that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.\\n\\nSanders\\'s campaign manager was [Shakir](Faiz)(Faiz Shakir). The campaign\\'s national co-chairs were [& Jerry\\'s](Ben)(Ben & Jerry\\'s) co-founder [Cohen](Ben)(Ben Cohen (businessman)), Representative [Khanna](Ro)(Ro Khanna), [Revolution](Our)(Our Revolution) President [Turner](Nina)(Nina Turner), and [Juan](San)(San Juan, Puerto Rico) mayor [Yulín Cruz](Carmen)(Carmen Yulín Cruz).\\n\\n### Campaign methods\\n\\nGiven the high national profile that Sanders maintained since his 2016 campaign, [NPR](NPR) described him as \"no longer an underdog\" when he announced his 2020 campaign. Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former [News](NowThis)(NowThis News) employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and launched a [podcast](podcast) and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.\\n\\n### Fundraising\\n\\nSanders\\'s 2020 campaign employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a [PAC](Super)(Super PAC) and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to [Election Commission](Federal)(Federal Election Commission) filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races. In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors. On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3&nbsp;million in the year\\'s third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate. The campaign raised $34.5&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of 2019.\\n\\n### Polls and news coverage\\n\\n[[File:Bernie Sanders - Rally at San Jose, CA - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Sanders campaigning for president in [Jose, California](San)(San Jose, California), March 2020]]\\n\\nSanders steadily polled between 15 and 20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the [RealClearPolitics](RealClearPolitics) average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden) until [Warren](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Warren) and [Harris](Kamala)(Kamala Harris) caught up in July. From mid-February 2020 to the start of March, Sanders polled in first place in the Democratic primary ahead of Joe Biden and was described by the press as the party\\'s presidential front-runner.\\n\\nAccording to a [RealClearPolitics](RealClearPolitics) analysis, Sanders received the third-most mentions on [CNN](CNN), [News](Fox)(Fox News), and [MSNBC](MSNBC) between January and August 2019, trailing only [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden) and [Harris](Kamala)(Kamala Harris). Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on *[World News Tonight](ABC)(ABC World News Tonight)* found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions \"reflect a slightly more balanced picture\", with both Sanders and [Warren](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Warren) running \"neck-and-neck\" with Biden.\\n\\n### Forums and other appearances\\n\\nOn April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a [News](Fox)(Fox News) town hall that attracted more than 2.55&nbsp;million viewers. His decision to appear on Fox was controversial given the [National Committee](Democratic)(Democratic National Committee)\\'s decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates. His appearance saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all other Democratic presidential candidate town halls that year. As of September 2019, the town hall had received more than 1.5&nbsp;million views on [YouTube](YouTube).\\n\\nOn August 6, 2019, Sanders appeared on *[Joe Rogan Experience](The)(The Joe Rogan Experience)* podcast. Some praised Rogan for \"hosting a pragmatic discussion\" while others \"seemed rather stunned by Sanders\\'s decision to appear on the show at all.\" After the podcast, Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic. After interviewing him, Rogan said, \"I am not right-wing&nbsp;... I\\'ve interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing&nbsp;... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him.\" As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than ten million views on YouTube.\\n\\n### Presidential debates\\n\\nIn December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. During the July and September debates, commentators described Sanders and [Warren](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Warren) as having a \"non-aggression pact\", staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more conservative candidates. In the October 15 debate, his first appearance since his heart attack, debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders\\'s performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates.\\n\\n[CNN](CNN) hosted the first 2020 debate in January with six candidates remaining. Co-moderator [Phillip](Abby)(Abby Phillip) questioned Sanders and Warren about an allegation Warren had made that he had privately told her that a woman could not defeat Donald Trump. Phillip asked Sanders, \"Senator Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?\" Ignoring Sanders\\'s strong denial, Phillip asked Warren, \"What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman couldn\\'t become president?\" In an interview after the debate, Sanders called it ludicrous to believe that he would doubt a woman\\'s ability to win the presidency and noted that a woman already *had* won the national [vote](popular)(United States presidential election#Popular vote), saying, \"After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.\"\\n\\n### Suspension of campaign\\n\\nSanders announced that he was suspending his campaign on April 8, 2020. He stated that he would remain on the ballot in the remaining states and continue to accumulate delegates with the goal of influencing the Democratic Party\\'s platform. On April 14 Sanders endorsed Biden. Biden responded, \"I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues but we\\'re awfully close on a whole bunch of others. I\\'m going to need you—not just to win the campaign, but to govern.\"\\n\\n## Political positions\\n\\nA self-described [socialist](democratic)(Democratic socialism),\\n\\n*\\n\\n* old U.S. senator from Vermont describes himself as a \\'democratic socialist.\\' |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-socialism-_b_7210120 |access-date=May 5, 2015}}\\n\\n*  Sanders is a [progressive](Progressivism in the United States) who admires [democratic](social)(social democracy) programs in Europe and supports [democracy](workplace)(workplace democracy) via [democracy](union)(union democracy), [cooperative](worker)(worker cooperative)s, and [management](workers\\')(workers\\' management) of [enterprises](public)(Public enterprise).*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\'I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves,\\' he wrote in 1976.}}\\n\\n*and exposing free market parasites |work=[Salon.com](Salon.com) |url=https://www.salon.com/2015/10/08/bernie_sanders_is_ayn_rands_worst_nightmare_hes_changing_how_we_view_socialism_and_exposing_free_market_parasites/ |access-date=February 14, 2020}}\\n\\n*\\n\\n* He is a strong critic of contemporary [neoliberal](neoliberal) capitalism, which he calls \"uber-capitalism\", blaming it for such societal ills as declining life expectancy and rising [of despair](diseases)(diseases of despair). He advocates [universal](universal healthcare), [healthcare](single-payer)(single-payer healthcare), paid [leave](parental)(parental leave), and tuition-free [education](tertiary)(tertiary education). He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S. He supported the [Care Act](Affordable)(Affordable Care Act), though he said it did not go far enough. In November 2015, he gave a speech at [University](Georgetown)(Georgetown University) about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents [D. Roosevelt](Franklin)(Franklin D. Roosevelt) and [B. Johnson](Lyndon)(Lyndon B. Johnson). Defining what \"democratic socialism\" means to him, Sanders said: \"I don\\'t believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.\"\\n\\nBased on his positions and votes throughout his career, many commentators consider his political platform primarily focused on tax-funded social benefits inspired by the [model](Nordic)(Nordic model) and not on [ownership](social)(social ownership) of the [of production](means)(means of production). Some socialists and major socialist organizations have described Sanders as a democratic socialist, [socialist](market)(Market socialism), or [socialist](reformist)(Reformist socialism), while others have called him a reformist social democrat.\\n\\n[Sunkara](Bhaskar)(Bhaskar Sunkara) has characterized Sanders\\' politics as \"[struggle](class)(class struggle) social democracy\", arguing that while [social democracy](postwar)(post-war social democracy) operated as a compromise that instituted [tripartite](Tripartism) arrangements between business, labor, and government to dampen class conflict, Sanders sees social democratic demands as a means to sharpening class confrontation and raising [consciousness](class)(class consciousness). His views have been echoed by [Eaton](George)(George Eaton (journalist)), arguing that Sunkara\\'s phrase \"captures the nuances of Sanders\\' politics in a way that a socialist / social democrat binary does not\" and asserting that if he was elected president it would represent \"the triumph of a politics that is neither wholly socialist, nor social democratic, but a new fusion of both\".\\n\\n### Climate change\\n\\nSanders views [warming](global)(global warming) as a serious problem, and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in [infrastructure](infrastructure), with energy efficiency, [sustainability](sustainability), and [creation](job)(job creation) as prominent goals. He considers [change the greatest threat](climate)(Climate change and national security) to national security. He said that [planning](family)(family planning) can help fight climate change. He opposed the construction of the [Access Pipeline](Dakota)(Dakota Access Pipeline) on the grounds that, like the [XL Pipeline](Keystone)(Keystone XL Pipeline), it \"will have a significant impact on our climate.\" In 2019, he announced his support for [New Deal](Green)(Green New Deal) legislation, and joined Representatives [Ocasio-Cortez](Alexandria)(Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and [Blumenauer](Earl)(Earl Blumenauer) in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.\\n\\n### Economic issues\\n\\nSanders focuses on economic issues such as [income](Income inequality in the United States) and [inequality](wealth)(Wealth inequality in the United States), [poverty](Poverty in the United States), raising the minimum wage, [healthcare](universal)(universal healthcare), cancelling all [debt](student)(student debt), making public colleges and universities tuition-free by [financial transactions](taxing)(Robin Hood tax), and expanding [Security](Social)(Social Security (United States)) benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000. He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers [leave](parental)(parental leave), [leave](sick)(sick leave), and [time](vacation)(List of statutory minimum employment leave by country), noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries. He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a [union](trade)(Labor unions in the United States). He was against the [Asset Relief Program](Troubled)(Troubled Asset Relief Program), and has called for comprehensive financial reforms, such as breaking up \"[big to fail](too)(too big to fail)\" financial institutions, restoring [legislation](Glass–Steagall)(Glass–Steagall legislation), reforming the [Reserve Bank](Federal)(Federal Reserve Bank), and allowing the [Office](Post)(United States Postal Service) to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.\\n\\nBelieving greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against [NAFTA](NAFTA), [CAFTA](CAFTA), and [PNTR](PNTR) with [China](China). He has called them a \"disaster for the American worker\", saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also opposes the [Partnership](Trans-Pacific)(Trans-Pacific Partnership), which he says was \"written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.\" On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: \"Since the [trade deal](China)(United States–China Relations Act of 2000) I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It\\'s wrong to pretend that China isn\\'t one of our major economic competitors.\"\\n\\nSanders also strongly opposes outsourcing American jobs. During discussions of the [States Innovation and Competition Act](United)(United States Innovation and Competition Act), which was to be used to fund the manufacture of [semiconductor](semiconductor)s amid a shortage, he proposed a measure to ensure the companies the bill funded could not outsource their jobs. The proposed measure would also block the companies from forbidding their employees to unionize. Sanders\\'s proposal was voted down by most Democrats and all Republicans in the Senate. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Sanders said he wants the Democratic Party to focus more on supporting unionization: \"I think we should move to a system where, if 50% of the workers in a bargaining unit plus one vote to form a union, they have a union. End of discussion.\"\\n\\nSanders supports establishing [cooperatives](worker-owned)(Worker cooperative) and introduced legislation numerous times from the 1990s to the 2020s that would aid workers who want to \"form their own businesses or to set up worker-owned cooperatives.\"Bernie Sanders (December 1, 2014).

In 2020, he called the [Israel Public Affairs Committee](American)(American Israel Public Affairs Committee) a platform for bigotry and said he would not attend its conference. He condemned Trump\\'s decision to [Jerusalem as Israel\\'s capital](recognize)(United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel), saying, \"It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an [peace agreement](Israeli-Palestinian)(Israeli–Palestinian peace process), and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States\\' ability to broker that peace.\"\\n\\nAddressing [College](Westminster)(Westminster College (Missouri)) in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a foreign policy plan for greater international collaboration, adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the [Agreement](Paris)(Paris Agreement) and the [nuclear deal framework](Iran)(Iran nuclear deal framework), and promoting human rights and democratic ideals.

He criticized Trump\\'s rolling back President Obama\\'s [Power Plan](Clean)(Clean Power Plan), noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump\\'s calling those reports a hoax. He called for caution on the [Civil War](Syrian)(Syrian Civil War), saying, \"It\\'s easier to get into a war than out of one.\" In 2017, he promised to defeat \"Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology\".\\n\\nSanders gave an online reply to Trump\\'s January 2018 State of the Union address in which he called Trump \"compulsively dishonest\" and criticized him for initiating \"a looming immigration crisis\" by ending the [Action for Childhood Arrivals](Deferred)(Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program. He voiced concern about Trump\\'s failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and \"will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding&nbsp;... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.\"\\n\\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump supporters [the United States Capitol](attacked)(January 6 United States Capitol attack). Sanders commented: \"[Trump] has made it clear that he will do anything to remain in power – including insurrection and inciting violence [he](and) will go down in history as the worst and most dangerous president in history.\"\\n\\nSanders voted to convict Trump on both articles of his [impeachment trial](first)(First impeachment trial of Donald Trump) in 2020 (for pressuring a foreign leader to investigate [Biden](Joe)(Joe Biden)), and again on the sole article of his [impeachment trial](second)(Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump) in 2021 (for inciting the Capitol attack).\\n\\n### Biden administration\\n\\nSanders influenced the [policy goals of the Biden administration](environmental)(Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration) as described before Biden\\'s nomination. Biden\\'s policy team took some but not all of the [Unity Task Forces](Biden-Sanders)(Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces)\\' climate recommendations.\\n\\nAfter Biden was elected president, Sanders became the subject of speculation over a potential appointment as [Secretary](Labor)(United States Secretary of Labor), which was supported by several progressive groups, such as the [Movement](Sunrise)(Sunrise Movement). For his part, Sanders said that he would accept Biden\\'s nomination if it was offered, but [Boston](Boston) mayor [Walsh](Marty)(Marty Walsh) was chosen for the position instead. When announcing Walsh\\'s nomination, Biden confirmed that he had discussed the position with Sanders, but the two agreed that Sanders\\'s resignation from the Senate and the ensuing special election would have put the Democrats\\' slim Senate majority at risk.\\n\\nOn February 23, 2021, Sanders became the first senator in the Democratic caucus to oppose one of Biden\\'s cabinet picks when he voted against [Vilsack](Tom)(Tom Vilsack)\\'s confirmation as [Secretary](Agriculture)(United States Secretary of Agriculture), citing concerns about Vilsack\\'s past work as a lobbyist and ties to large corporations.\\n\\nSanders strongly supported Senate Democrats\\' decision to use [reconciliation](budget)(Reconciliation (United States Congress)), a procedure used to avoid [filibusters](Filibuster in the United States Senate), to pass the [Rescue Plan Act of 2021](American)(American Rescue Plan Act of 2021), despite having criticized Republicans\\' use of reconciliation to pass the [tax cuts](2017)(Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). The bill passed the Senate by a 50–49 vote and was signed into law by Biden on March 11, 2021.\\n\\nSanders has continued to have a strong influence on the Biden administration. When it was noted that he had become a key voice in Biden\\'s administration, he replied, \"As somebody who wrote a book called *Outsider in the House*, yes, it is a strange experience to be having that kind of influence that we have now.\" Their relationship has lasted over 30 years and Sanders has said it is based on respect and trust: \"We have had a good relationship. He wants to be a champion of working families, and I admire that and respect that.\"\\n\\nBefore the [midterm election](2022)(2022 United States elections), Sanders said he regarded it as deciding the fate of democracy, abortion, and climate change, calling it \"the most consequential midterm election\" of modern U.S. history. He expressed a fear that the Democratic Party had \"not done a good enough job\" of getting its message out \"to young people and working-class people.\" After the election, Sanders said it \"went a hell of a lot better than we had anticipated\" and that \"discussion about the economy\" had \"a very strong impact\" that helped Democrats. He also pointed to [Fetterman](John)(John Fetterman)\\'s successful campaign as a model for future Democratic efforts, saying that Fetterman had \"strongly identified with the working class\" during the [election](Pennsylvania)(2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania).\\n\\n## Party affiliations\\n\\nBorn into a [Democratic](Democratic Party (United States))-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother [Larry](Larry Sanders (politician)) joined the [Democrats of America](Young)(Young Democrats of America) and campaigned for [Stevenson II](Adlai)(Adlai Stevenson II) in 1956. Sanders joined Vermont\\'s [Union Party](Liberty)(Liberty Union Party) in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman, but quit in 1977 to become an independent. In 1980, he served as an elector for the [Workers Party](Socialist)(Socialist Workers Party (United States)). In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times. Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates [Mondale](Walter)(Walter Mondale) in [1984](1984 United States presidential election) and [Jackson](Jesse)(Jesse Jackson) in [1988](Jesse Jackson presidential campaign, 1988). His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically. *[Washington Post](The)(The Washington Post)* reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.\\n\\nSanders attended the 1983 conference of the [Party USA](Socialist)(Socialist Party USA) where he gave a speech.\\n\\nSanders first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in [1988](1988 United States House of Representatives election in Vermont) and for the U.S. Senate in [2006](2006 United States Senate election in Vermont), each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election. He continued this strategy through his reelection in the [United States Senate election in Vermont](2018)(2018 United States Senate election in Vermont). Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with Democrats in the House while refusing to join the party, and continues to caucus with Democrats in the Senate. Some conservative southern House Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects. He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in Congress.\\n\\nStarting with his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders\\'s announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, \"Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.\" Since he remained a senator elected as an independent, his U.S. Senate website and press materials continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate.See [search results for \"Sanders (I-VT)\" at www.senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/general/search/search_cfm.cfm?q=+%22Sanders+%28I-VT%29%22&x=16&y=10&site=default_collection&num=10&filter=0). In October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 despite pressure to run as a Democrat. His party status became ambiguous again in March 2019 when he signed a formal \"loyalty pledge\" to the Democratic Party stating that he was a member of the party and would serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.\\n\\nAfter Trump\\'s victory in the 2016 el\\n',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Bernie Sanders is a prominent American politician who has served as the senior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007, after previously representing Vermont’s at-large congressional district in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007. Notably, Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, although he has caucused with the Democratic Party throughout his career. A self-described democratic socialist and leading figure of the progressive movement, Sanders has twice run for the Democratic presidential nomination, in 2016 and 2020, finishing second both times and significantly influencing the party’s platform. His early political career included serving as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, where he gained national attention for his progressive policies and effective governance.\\n\\nSanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a working-class Jewish family, and became politically active during his college years at the University of Chicago, participating in the civil rights movement and antiwar protests. After moving to Vermont in 1968, he became involved in third-party politics, running for various offices with the Liberty Union Party before winning the Burlington mayoral race in 1981. As mayor, he spearheaded urban revitalization projects, promoted affordable housing, and built coalitions that broadened his support base. Entering national politics as a congressman, Sanders became known for his advocacy on issues such as economic inequality, healthcare reform, labor rights, veterans’ affairs, and opposition to corporate influence, foreign wars, and trade agreements he deemed harmful to American workers.\\n\\nThroughout his Senate tenure, Sanders has championed progressive causes, including universal healthcare (Medicare for All), tuition-free public college, a $15 minimum wage, climate action through a Green New Deal, and expanded workers’ rights. His presidential campaigns galvanized a grassroots movement powered by small-dollar donations and emphasized social and economic justice, helping to shift the Democratic Party’s agenda leftward. Sanders continues to play a significant role in national politics as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a leading voice on progressive policy, and a key ally influencing the Biden administration’s policy directions.',\n",

In some countries [paramilitary](paramilitary) forces are included in a nation\\'s armed forces, though not considered military. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as [insurgent](Insurgency) forces, often [mimic](mimic) military organizations, or use these structures, while formal military organization tends to use [hierarchical](hierarchical) forms.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThe use of formalized [ranks](Military rank) in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the [Army](Roman)(Roman Army).\\n\\nIn modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by governments through a [department](government)(Ministry (government department)) within the structure of [administration](public)(public administration), often known as a [ ministry of defence or department of defense](Ministry of defence). These in turn manage [branches](military)(military branches) that themselves command formations and units specialising in combat, [support](combat)(combat support) and [support](combat-service)(combat service support).\\n\\n## Executive control, management and administration\\n\\nThe usually [or partly civilian executive control over the national military organization](civilian)(civilian control of the military) is exercised in [democracies](democracy)  by an elected political leader as a member of the government\\'s [cabinet](Cabinet (government)), usually known as a [of defence](minister)(minister of defence). In [system](presidential)(presidential system)s, such as the [States](United)(United States Armed Forces), the president is the [commander-in-chief](commander-in-chief), and the cabinet-level defense minister is second in command. Subordinated to that position are often [secretaries](Secretary (title)) for specific major operational divisions of the armed forces as a whole, such as those that provide general support services to the military, including their dependants.\\n\\nThen there are the heads of specific departmental agencies responsible for the provision and management of specific skill- and knowledge-based services such as [strategic](Strategy) advice, [development](capability)(Military capability) assessment, or [science](military)(military science) provision of research, and design and development of technologies. Within each departmental agency will be found administrative branches responsible for further agency [specialization](business)(business) work.\\n\\n## Military branches\\n\\n[[Image:USN-JASDF ship and aircraft formations during ANNUALEX 2008 081119-N-7047S-140.jpg|thumb|A mixed aircraft and ship formation of military vehicles during an exercise with [USN](United States Navy) and [JASDF](Japan Air Self-Defense Force) vehicles.]]\\n\\nIn most countries, the *armed forces* are divided into three [branch](military)(military branch)es (also *service, armed service, or military service*): [army](army), [navy](navy), and [force](air)(air force).\\n\\nMany countries have a variation on the standard model of three basic military branches. Some nations also organize their [force](cyber)(cyber force), emergencies service, [service](medical)(Military medicine), [logistics](military)(military logistics), [force](space)(space force), [marines](marines), and [forces](special)(special forces) such as [commando](commando)s or [forces](airborne)(airborne forces) as independent armed services. A nation\\'s [guard](border)(border guard) or [guard](coast)(coast guard) may also be an independent branch of its military, although in many nations border guard or coast guard is a civil [enforcement agency](law)(law enforcement agency). A number of countries have no navy, for geographical reasons.\\n\\nIn larger armed forces, the cultures between the different branches of the armed forces can be quite different.\\n\\nMost smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question. Armies of [countries](developing)(developing country) tend to consist primarily of [infantry](infantry), while [countries](developed)(developed country) armies tend to have larger units manning expensive equipment and only a fraction of personnel in infantry units.\\n\\nIn western militaries, a [force](joint)(joint warfare) is defined as a unit or formation comprising representation of combat power from two or more branches of the military.\\n\\n### Internal security forces\\n\\n[Gendarmerie](Gendarmerie)s, [police](military)(military police) and [forces](security)(security forces), including equivalents such as [forces](paramilitary)(Paramilitary), [militia](militia), [troops](internal)(Internal Troops) and [tactical unit](police)(police tactical unit) similar, are an [security](internal)(internal security) service common in most of the world, but uncommon in countries with English [law](common)(common law) histories where civil police are employed to enforce the law, and there are tight restrictions on how the armed forces may be used to assist.\\n\\n## Commands, formations, and units\\n\\nIt is common, at least in the European and North American militaries, to refer to the building blocks of a military as [[(military formation)|s](Command)], **s**, and **s**.\\n\\nIn a military context, a command is a collection of units and formations under the control of a single officer, although during the [World War](Second)(Second World War) a command was also a name given to a [group](battle)(Battlegroup (army)) in the [Army](US)(US Army). In general it is an administrative and executive [strategic](military strategy) [headquarters](headquarters) that is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation\\'s services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the [Army](Belgian)(Belgian Army)), but this does not preclude the existence of commands that are not service-based.\\n\\nA formation is defined by the [Department of Defense](US)(United States Department of Defense) as \"two or more aircraft, ships, or units proceeding together under a commander\".[States Department of Defense](United)(United States Department of Defense), [DOD Dictionary](http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html)  Fomin in the *[Soviet Encyclopedia](Great)(Great Soviet Encyclopedia)* emphasised its combined-arms nature: \"Formations are those military organisations which are formed from different speciality Arms and Services troop units to create a balanced, combined combat force. The formations only differ in their ability to achieve different scales of application of force to achieve different strategic, operational and tactical goals and mission objectives.\"Fomin, N. N., *Great Soviet Encyclopaedia* (), Moscow, 1978 It is a composite military organization that includes a mixture of integrated and operationally attached sub-units, and is usually combat-capable. Example of formations include: [division](Division (military))s, [brigade](brigade)s, [battalion](battalion)s, [wings](Wing (air force unit)), etc. Formation may also refer to [formation](tactical)(tactical formation), the physical arrangement or disposition of troops and weapons.*[Oxford English Dictionary](Shorter)(Shorter Oxford English Dictionary)* Examples of formation in such usage include: [pakfront](pakfront), [panzerkeil](panzerkeil), [formation](testudo)(testudo formation), etc.\\n\\nA typical unit is a homogeneous military organization (either combat, [combat-support](Combat support) or non-combat in capability) that includes service personnel predominantly from a single arm of service, or a branch of service, and its administrative and command functions are self-contained. Any unit subordinate to another unit is considered its sub-unit or minor unit. It is not uncommon in the United States for unit and formation to be used synonymously. In [of Nations](Commonwealth)(Commonwealth of Nations) practice, formation is not used for smaller organizations such as battalions, which are instead called \"units\", and their constituent [platoon](platoon)s or [companies](Company (military unit)) are referred to as sub-units. In the Commonwealth, formations are divisions, brigades, etc.\\n\\nDifferent [forces](armed)(armed forces), and even different branches of service of the armed forces, may use the same name to denote different types of organizations. An example is the \"squadron\". In most navies a [squadron](Squadron (naval)) is a formation of several ships; in most air forces it is a unit; in the U.S. Army it is a battalion-sized [cavalry](cavalry) unit; and in Commonwealth armies a squadron is a company-sized sub-unit.\\n\\n## Table of organization and equipment\\n\\nA [of organization and equipment](table)(table of organization and equipment) (TOE or TO&E) is a document published by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency that prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.\\n\\nIt also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit\\'s current status. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines.\\n\\n## Modern hierarchy\\n\\n### Army\\n\\nThe following table gives an overview of some of the terms used to describe army hierarchy in armed forces across the world. Whilst it is recognized that there are differences between armies of different nations, many are modeled on the [British](British Army) or [American](United States Armed Forces) models, or both. However, many military units and formations go back in history for a long time, and were devised by various military thinkers throughout European history.\\n\\nFor example, the modern *Corps* was first introduced in France about 1805 by Napoleon as a more flexible tactical grouping of two or more divisions during the [Wars](Napoleonic)(Napoleonic Wars).\\n\\nRungs may be skipped in this ladder: for example, typically NATO forces skip from battalion to brigade. Likewise, only large military powers may have organizations at the top levels and different armies and countries may also use traditional names, creating considerable confusion: for example, a British or Canadian armored regiment (battalion) is divided into [squadron](Squadron (army))s (companies) and [troop](troop)s (platoons), whereas an American cavalry squadron (battalion) is divided into troops (companies) and platoons. In the French system (used by many African countries) the company is divided into sections (platoons) composed of 3 x \"groupes de combat\" of 7 soldiers, plus a group of vehicle crews and a HQ that includes 2 x snipers.\\n\\n[Army](Army (unit)), [group](army)(army group), [region](region), and [theatre](theater (military)) are all large formations that vary significantly between armed forces in size and hierarchy position.  While [division](Division (military))s were the traditional level at which support elements (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) were added to the unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving support elements.  A regiment with such support elements is called a [combat team](regimental)(regimental combat team) in US military parlance, or a [battlegroup](Battlegroup (army)) in the UK and other forces. Canadian Army doctrine also includes the [team](combat)(combat team) which is a company of infantry augmented with tanks, or a squadron of tanks augmented with infantry, or the combination of a full company of infantry with a full squadron of tanks.\\n\\nDuring [War II](World)(World War II) the [Army](Red)(Red Army) used the same basic organizational structure.  However, in the beginning many units were greatly underpowered and their size was actually one level below on the ladder that is usually used elsewhere; for example, a division in the early-WWII Red Army would have been about the size of most nations\\' regiments or brigades. At the top of the ladder, what other nations would call an army group, the Red Army called a [front](Front (Soviet Army)). By contrast, during the same period the German [Wehrmacht](Wehrmacht) army groups, particularly on the [Front](Eastern)(Eastern Front (World War II)), such as [Group Centre](Army)(Army Group Centre) significantly exceeded the above numbers, and were more cognate with the Soviet [Direction](Strategic)(Strategic Direction)s.\\n\\n### Navy\\n\\nNaval organization at the [flotilla](flotilla) level and higher is less commonly abided by, as ships operate in smaller or larger groups in various situations that may change at a moment\\'s notice.  However, there is some common terminology used throughout navies to communicate the general concept of how many vessels might be in a unit.\\n\\nNavies are generally organized into groups for a specific purpose, usually strategic, and these organizational groupings appear and disappear frequently based on the conditions and demands placed upon a navy.  This contrasts with army organization where units remain static, with the same men and equipment, over long periods of time.\\n\\nThe five-star ranks of [of the fleet](admiral)(admiral of the fleet) and fleet admiral have largely been out of regular use since the 1990s, with the exception of ceremonial or honorary appointments. Currently, all major navies ([blue-water](Blue-water navy) and [green-water](Green-water navy) navies) are commanded by an [admiral](admiral) of either four-star rank or three-star rank depending on relative size. Smaller naval forces, such as the [New Zealand Navy](Royal)(Royal New Zealand Navy), or those navies that are effectively [guard](coast)(coast guard)s, are commanded by a [rear-admiral](rear-admiral) (two-star rank), [commodore](Commodore (rank)) (one-star rank) or even a [captain](Captain (naval)).\\n\\n[carrier](Aircraft)(Aircraft carrier)s are typically commanded by a captain. [Submarine](Submarine)s and [destroyer](destroyer)s are typically commanded by a captain or commander.  Some destroyers, particularly smaller destroyers such as [frigate](frigate)s (formerly known as [escort](destroyer)(destroyer escort)s) are usually commanded by officers with the rank of commander. [Corvette](Corvette)s, the smallest class of warship, are commanded by officers with the rank of commander or [lieutenant-commander](lieutenant-commander). Auxiliary ships, including [gunboat](gunboat)s, [minesweepers](Minesweeper (ship)), [boat](patrol)(patrol boat)s, military [craft](riverine)(riverboat), [tenders](Ship\\'s tender) and [boat](torpedo)(torpedo boat)s are usually commanded by [lieutenant](lieutenant)s, [sub-lieutenant](sub-lieutenant)s or [officers](warrant)(warrant officers).  Usually, the smaller the vessel, the lower the rank of the ship\\'s commander.  For example, [boat](patrol)(patrol boat)s are often commanded by [ensign](Ensign (rank))s, while frigates are rarely commanded by an officer below the rank of commander.\\n\\nHistorically, navies were far more rigid in structure.  Ships were collected in [divisions](Division (naval)), which in turn were collected in numbered [squadrons](Squadron (naval)), which comprised a numbered [fleet](Naval fleet).  Permission for a vessel to leave one unit and join another would have to be approved on paper.\\n\\nThe modern U.S. Navy is primarily based on a number of standard groupings of vessels, including the [strike group](carrier)(carrier strike group) and the [strike group](expeditionary)(expeditionary strike group).\\n\\nAdditionally, naval organization continues aboard a single ship. The complement forms three or four departments (such as tactical and engineering), each of which has a number of divisions, followed by work centers.\\n\\n### Air force\\n\\nThe organizational structures of air forces vary between nations: some air forces (such as the [States Air Force](United)(United States Air Force) and the [Air Force](Royal)(Royal Air Force)) are divided into commands, groups and squadrons; others (such as the [Air Force](Soviet)(Soviet Air Force)) have an Army-style organizational structure.  The modern [Canadian Air Force](Royal)(Royal Canadian Air Force) uses [division](Air)(Air division) as the formation between wings and the entire air command.  Like the RAF, Canadian wings consist of squadrons.\\n\\n## Task force\\n\\nA [force](task)(task force) is a unit or formation created as a temporary grouping for a specific operational purpose.  Aside from administrative hierarchical forms of organization that have evolved since the early 17th century in Europe, fighting forces have been grouped for specific operational purposes into mission-related organizations such as the German [Kampfgruppe](Kampfgruppe) or the U.S. Combat Team (Army) and Task Force (Navy) during the Second World War, or the Soviet [manoeuvre group](Operational)(Operational manoeuvre group) during the Cold War. In the British and Commonwealth armies the [battlegroup](Battlegroup (army)) became the usual grouping of companies during the [World War](Second)(Second World War) and the Cold War.\\n\\nWithin NATO, a [Task Force](Joint)(Joint Task Force) (JTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n* [(military)](Chalk)(Chalk (military))\\n\\n* [and control](Command)(Command and control)\\n\\n* [administration](Military)(Military administration)\\n\\n## Explanatory notes\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[ ](Category:Military organization)\\n\\n[Organization](Category:Military science)\\n',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Military organization refers to the structured arrangement and management of a state's armed forces to meet defense policy needs. It typically employs a hierarchical system of ranks, a model that traces back to the Roman Army, and is overseen by a civilian authority such as a minister or president in democratic countries. Modern military organization is divided into branches—commonly the army, navy, and air force—with some countries also maintaining forces for cyber, space, special operations, and border or coast protection. Paramilitary and internal security organizations, such as gendarmeries and military police, are also part of many national defense structures.\\n\\nThe core building blocks of military organization are commands, formations, and units. A command is a collection of units under a single officer, often responsible for strategic or operational objectives. Formations are composite organizations consisting of various unit types (e.g., divisions, brigades, battalions) designed for combined-arms operations, while units are more homogeneous and self-contained, typically comprising personnel from a single branch. The exact naming and hierarchy of these elements can vary significantly between countries, branches, and historical periods, with different conventions for the organization of armies, navies, and air forces, as well as the integration of support and specialized elements.\\n\\nModern military hierarchies can be complex, with different nations adopting variations on traditional structures. Armies may be organized into corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments, with additional support elements increasingly integrated at lower levels since World War II. Naval organization is generally more fluid, with ships grouped into task-oriented formations that can change rapidly, while air forces may use either army-like or unique structures based on national preferences. Temporary groupings such as task forces and battlegroups are used for specific operational missions, often involving multiple branches or nations, reflecting the flexible and adaptive nature of contemporary military operations.\",\n",

He is considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.\\n\\nFrom 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the [of Cambridge](University)(University of Cambridge). In spite of his position, during his entire life only one book of his philosophy was published, the 75-page *Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung* (*Logical-Philosophical Treatise*, 1921), which appeared, together with an English translation, in 1922 under the Latin title *[Logico-Philosophicus](Tractatus)(Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus)*. His only other published works were an article, \"[Remarks on Logical Form](Some)(Some Remarks on Logical Form)\" (1929); a book review; and a children\\'s dictionary..}}.}} [voluminous manuscripts](His)(#Works) were edited and published posthumously. The first and best-known of this posthumous series is the 1953 book *[Investigations](Philosophical)(Philosophical Investigations)*. A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the *Investigations* as the most important book of [philosophy](20th-century)(20th-century philosophy), standing out as \"the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations\".\\n\\nHis philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the *Tractatus*, and a later period, articulated primarily in the *Philosophical Investigations*.His mentor Bertrand Russell was likely the first to coin this distinction in Wittgenstein\\'s work. The \"early Wittgenstein\" was concerned with the logical relationship between [proposition](proposition)s and the world, and he believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The \"later Wittgenstein\", however, rejected many of the assumptions of the *Tractatus*, arguing that the [meaning](Meaning (philosophy)) of words is best understood as their use within a given [game](language)(Language game (philosophy)).\\n\\nBorn in [Vienna](Vienna) into one of Europe\\'s richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. Before [War I](World)(World War I), he \"made a very generous financial bequest to a group of poets and artists chosen by Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of *Der Brenner*, from artists in need. These included [Trakl](Georg Trakl) as well as [Maria Rilke](Rainer)(Rainer Maria Rilke) and the architect [Loos](Adolf)(Adolf Loos).\"Wittgenstein, Ludwig, *Private Notebooks: 1914–1916* (edited and translated by [Perloff](Marjorie)(Marjorie Perloff)), New York: Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2022, p. 79. Later, in a period of severe personal depression after World War I, he gave away his remaining fortune to his brothers and sisters. Three of his four older brothers died by separate acts of suicide. Wittgenstein left academia several times: serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was [decorated](Military awards and decorations) a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages, where he encountered controversy for using sometimes violent corporal punishment on girls and a boy (the [incident](Haidbauer)(Haidbauer incident)) especially during mathematics classes; working during [War II](World)(World War II) as a [porter](hospital)(hospital porter) in London, notably telling patients not to take the drugs they were prescribed; and working as a hospital laboratory technician at the [Victoria Infirmary](Royal)(Royal Victoria Infirmary) in [upon Tyne](Newcastle)(Newcastle upon Tyne). He later expressed remorse for these incidents, and spent the remainder of his life lecturing and attempting to prepare a second manuscript for publication, which was published posthumously as the hugely influential *Philosophical Investigations*.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\n### The Wittgensteins\\n\\n[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|left|thumb|[Wittgenstein](Karl)(Karl Wittgenstein) was one of the richest men in Europe.]]\\n\\nAccording to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after [War II](World)(World War II), Wittgenstein\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier, a [Jewish](Ashkenazi Jews) land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [Laasphe](Bad)(Bad Laasphe) in the [of Wittgenstein](Principality)(Siegen-Wittgenstein), [Westphalia](Westphalia).See [Wittgenstein](Schloss)(:de:Schloss Wittgenstein). Various sources spell Meier\\'s name Maier and Meyer. In July 1808, [Napoleon](Napoleon) issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [surname](family)(Jewish surname), so Meier\\'s son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [Sayn-Wittgenstein](Sayn-Wittgenstein)s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein. His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein — who took the middle name \"Christian\" to distance himself from his Jewish background — married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to [Protestantism](Protestantism) just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig. Ludwig\\'s grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the violinist [Joachim](Joseph)(Joseph Joachim).\\n\\nThey had 11 children – among them Wittgenstein\\'s father. [Otto Clemens Wittgenstein](Karl)(Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein) (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria\\'s steel cartel. Thanks to Karl, the Wittgensteins became the second wealthiest family in the [Empire](Austro-Hungarian)(Austro-Hungarian Empire), only the [Rothschilds](Rothschild family) being wealthier. Karl Wittgenstein was viewed as the Austrian equivalent of [Carnegie](Andrew)(Andrew Carnegie), with whom he was friends, and was one of the wealthiest men in the world by the 1890s. As a result of his decision in 1898 to invest substantially in the Netherlands and in Switzerland as well as overseas, particularly in the US, the family was to an extent shielded from the [that hit Austria in 1922](hyperinflation)(Hyperinflation#Austria). However, their wealth diminished due to post-1918 hyperinflation and subsequently during the [Depression](Great)(Great Depression), although even as late as 1938 they owned 13 mansions in Vienna alone.\\n\\n### Early life\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein 03.jpg|thumb|Palais Wittgenstein, the family home, around 1910](File:Palais)]\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s mother was Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kalmus, known among friends as Poldi. Her father was a [Bohemian](Czechs) [Jew](Jew) and her mother was [Austria](Austria)n-[Slovene](Slovenes) [Catholic](Catholic) – she was Wittgenstein\\'s only non-Jewish grandparent. She was an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate [Hayek](Friedrich)(Friedrich Hayek) on her maternal side. Wittgenstein was born at 8:30&nbsp; on 26&nbsp;April 1889 in the \"Villa Wittgenstein\" at what is today Neuwaldegger Straße 38 in the suburban parish  next to Vienna.\\n\\n[[The infant Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ludwig, c. 1890s](File:1.)]\\n\\nKarl and Poldi had nine children in all – four girls: Hermine, [Margaret](Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein) (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter Dora who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [Paul](Paul Wittgenstein) – who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in World War I – and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.\\n\\n[[as a child.jpg|thumb|Ludwig sitting in a field as a child](File:Ludwig)]\\n\\nThe children were baptized as Catholics, received formal Catholic instruction, and were raised in an exceptionally intense environment. The family was at the center of Vienna\\'s cultural life; [Walter](Bruno)(Bruno Walter) described the life at the Wittgensteins\\' palace as an \"all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture.\" Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [Rodin](Auguste)(Auguste Rodin) and financing the city\\'s exhibition hall and art gallery, the [Building](Secession)(Secession hall (Austria)). [Klimt](Gustav)(Gustav Klimt) painted Wittgenstein\\'s sister for her wedding portrait, and [Brahms](Johannes)(Johannes Brahms) and [Mahler](Gustav)(Gustav Mahler) gave regular concerts in the family\\'s numerous music rooms.\\n\\nWittgenstein, who valued precision and discipline, never considered [music](contemporary)(contemporary music) acceptable. He said to his friend Drury in 1930: }}Ludwig Wittgenstein himself had [pitch](absolute)(absolute pitch), and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life; he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and he was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages. He also learnt to play the [clarinet](clarinet) in his 30s. A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by [Nedo](Michael)(Michael Nedo), director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.\\n\\n### Family temperament and the brothers\\' suicides\\n\\n[[File:The Wittgensteins 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|left|From left, Helene, Rudi, Hermine, Ludwig (the baby), [Gretl](Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein), [Paul](Paul Wittgenstein), Hans, and Kurt, around 1890]]\\n\\n[Monk](Ray)(Ray Monk) writes that Karl\\'s aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl\\'s industrial empire. Three of the five brothers would later commit suicide. Psychiatrist [Fitzgerald](Michael)(Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)) argues that Karl was a harsh perfectionist who lacked empathy, and that Wittgenstein\\'s mother was anxious and insecure, unable to stand up to her husband. Johannes Brahms said of the family, whom he visited regularly: }}The family appeared to have a strong streak of depression running through it. [Gottlieb](Anthony)(Anthony Gottlieb) tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins\\' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room:\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein siblings.jpg|thumb|Ludwig (bottom-right), Paul, and their sisters, late 1890s](File:Ludwig)]\\n\\nThe family palace housed seven grand pianos and each of the siblings pursued music \"with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological\". The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes [Waugh](Alexander)(Alexander Waugh), Hans could identify the [effect](Doppler)(Doppler effect) in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying \"Wrong! Wrong!\" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [keys](Key signature). But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [Bay](Chesapeake)(Chesapeake Bay), most likely having committed suicide.\\n\\nTwo years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [Academy](Berlin)(Prussian Academy of Sciences), the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play [Koschat](Thomas)(Thomas Koschat)\\'s \"*Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich*\" (\"Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I\"), before mixing himself a drink of milk and [cyanide](potassium)(potassium cyanide). He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his \"perverted disposition\". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [Committee](Scientific-Humanitarian)(Scientific-Humanitarian Committee), an organization that was campaigning against [175](Paragraph)(Paragraph 175) of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again., citing an unnamed Berlin newspaper, cited in turn by Bartley, p. 36.\\n\\nThe second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 just before the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted *en masse*. According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry \"the germ of disgust for life within himself\". Later, Ludwig wrote: }}\\n\\n## 1903–1906: Realschule in Linz\\n\\n### Realschule in Linz\\n\\n[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The *[Realschule](Realschule)* in [Linz](Linz)]]\\n\\nWittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was 14&nbsp;years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [*Gymnasium*](Gymnasium (school)) in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [k.u.k.](Imperial and Royal) *[Realschule](Realschule)* in [Linz](Linz), a small state school with 300&nbsp;pupils. In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.\\n\\nOn starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year. Historian [Hamann](Brigitte)(Brigitte Hamann) writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [German](High)(High German) with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable. Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: \"Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts\" (\"Wittgenstein wanders wistfully Vienna-wards (in) worsening winds\"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing. He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931:}}\\n\\n### Faith\\n\\nWittgenstein was [baptized](baptized) as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time. In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather\\'s \"strong, severe, partly ascetic [Christianity](Christianity)\" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.Stonborough-Wittgenstein, Gretl. Reviewed in \"Portraits of Wittgenstein\", *Flowers & Ground*. While he was at the *Realschule*, he decided he lacked religious faith and began reading [Schopenhauer](Arthur)(Arthur Schopenhauer) per Gretl\\'s recommendation. He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of [confession](confession). He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the *Realschule*; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to Schopenhauer\\'s *[World as Will and Representation](The)(The World as Will and Representation)*. As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer\\'s [idealism](epistemological)(Transcendental idealism). However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [Frege](Gottlob)(Gottlob Frege)\\'s [realism](conceptual)(Logical realism). In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately \"shallow\" thinker: }}Wittgenstein\\'s relationship with [Christianity](Christianity) and with [religion](religion) in general, for which he always professed a sincere and devoted sympathy, would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God. However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to \"bend the knee\",Portraits of Wittgenstein, 113 though his grandfather\\'s beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein – as he said, \"I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view.\"Wittgenstein, Ludwig, reviewed in \\'\\'Wittgenstein\\'s Religious Point of View*, Tim Labron Wittgenstein referred to [of Hippo](Augustine)(Augustine of Hippo) in his *Philosophical Investigations\\'\\'. Philosophically, Wittgenstein\\'s thought shows alignment with religious discourse. For example, he would become one of the century\\'s fiercest critics of [scientism](scientism).\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s religious belief emerged during his service for the Austrian army in World War I, and he was a devoted reader of Dostoevsky\\'s and Tolstoy\\'s religious writings. He viewed his wartime experiences as a trial in which he strove to conform to the will of God, and in a journal entry from 29 April 1915, he writes: }} Around this time, Wittgenstein wrote that \"Christianity is indeed the only sure way to happiness\", but he rejected the idea that religious belief was merely thinking that a certain doctrine was true. From this time on, Wittgenstein viewed religious faith as a way of living and opposed rational argumentation or proofs for God.\\n\\nWith age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religionattacking, for example, the temptation to think of God\\'s existence as a matter of scientific evidence.Ludwig Wittgenstein, \"Lectures on Religious Belief\" In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote:In *Culture and Value*, Wittgenstein writes:His close friend Norman Malcolm would write:}}Toward the end, Wittgenstein wrote:\\n\\n### Influence of Otto Weininger\\n\\n[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [Weininger](Otto)(Otto Weininger) (1880–1903)]]\\n\\nWhile a student at the *Realschule*, Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [Weininger](Otto)(Otto Weininger)\\'s 1903 book *Geschlecht und Charakter* (*[and Character](Sex)(Sex and Character)*).\\n\\nWeininger (1880–1903), who was Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [forms](Platonic)(Platonic realism), and that Jews tend to embody the Platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one – to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Wittgenstein, then 14, attended Weininger\\'s funeral. Many years later, as a professor at the [of Cambridge](University)(University of Cambridge), Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger\\'s book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger\\'s arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting. In a letter dated 23&nbsp;August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [E. Moore](G.)(G. E. Moore):}}In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger\\'s work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June, when he probably gave this copy to Moore.\\n\\n### Jewish background and Hitler\\n\\nThere is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein\\'s schooldays, because [Hitler](Adolf)(Adolf Hitler) was, for a while, at the same school at the same time. Laurence Goldstein argues that it is \"overwhelmingly probable\" that the boys met each other and that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a \"stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart&nbsp;...\" Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein\\'s wealth and unusual personality might have fed Hitler\\'s antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.\\n\\nWittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the *Realschule*.}} Monk estimates that they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but says there is no evidence they had anything to do with each other.}}}} Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner,\\n\\n*  and at the Galerija Nova, Zagreb in 2006.}}\\n\\n*  }} The archive gives the date as circa 1901, but wrongly calls the place the *Realschule* in Leonding, near Linz. Hitler attended primary school in Leonding, but from September 1901 went to the *Realschule* in Linz itself.Kershaw, Ian. *Hitler, 1889–1936*. W. W.

Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing:}}While Wittgenstein would later claim that \"[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic\", as [Sluga](Hans)(Hans Sluga) has argued, if so, }}By Hebraic, he meant to include the Christian tradition, in contradistinction to the Greek tradition, holding that good and evil could not be reconciled.\\n\\n## 1906–1913: University\\n\\n### Engineering at Berlin and Manchester\\n\\n[[Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen](File:10.)]\\n\\n[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|The old [Hochschule Berlin](Technische)(Berlin Institute of Technology) in [Charlottenburg](Charlottenburg), Berlin]]\\n\\nHe began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [Hochschule Berlin](Technische)(Berlin Institute of Technology) in [Charlottenburg](Charlottenburg), Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [diploma](diploma) (*Abgangzeugnis*) on 5 May 1908.\\n\\nDuring his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [aeronautics](aeronautics). He arrived at the [University of Manchester](Victoria)(Victoria University of Manchester) in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [Glossop](Glossop) in [Derbyshire](Derbyshire). Specifically, the [Meteorological Society](Royal)(Royal Meteorological Society) researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop, Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [Schuster](Arthur)(Arthur Schuster).\\n\\nHe also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908. At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein\\'s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein\\'s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein\\'s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and thus creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.\\n\\n[[File:11. With Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in Glossop.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Ludwig with his friend William  Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in [Glossop](Glossop), Derbyshire]]\\n\\nWork on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery. Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that }}According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller – a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.\\n\\nIt was at this time that he became interested in the [of mathematics](foundations)(foundations of mathematics), particularly after reading [Russell](Bertrand)(Bertrand Russell)\\'s *[Principles of Mathematics](The)(The Principles of Mathematics)* (1903), and [Frege](Gottlob)(Gottlob Frege)\\'s *[Foundations of Arithmetic](The)(The Foundations of Arithmetic)*, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein\\'s sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a \"constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation.\" In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the [of Jena](University)(University of Jena) to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: }}\\n\\n### Arrival at Cambridge\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein 1910.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Wittgenstein, 1910s](File:Ludwig)]\\n\\nWittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the [of Cambridge](University)(University of Cambridge) to study under Russell, so on 18&nbsp;October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell\\'s rooms in [College](Trinity)(Trinity College, Cambridge). Russell was having tea with [K. Ogden](C.)(C. K. Ogden), when, according to Russell, }}He was soon not only attending Russell\\'s lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [D. Broad](C.)(C. D. Broad), [H. Neville](E.)(Eric Harold Neville), and H. T. J. Norton. Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [Hall](Formal (university)#Terminology). Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [Ottoline Morrell](Lady)(Lady Ottoline Morrell): \"My German friend threatens to be an infliction.\"\\n\\nRussell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein\\'s written work. He wrote in November&nbsp;1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: }} Three months after Wittgenstein\\'s arrival Russell told Morrell:}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell\\'s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein\\'s life. The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell\\'s own work:}}\\n\\n### Cambridge Moral Sciences Club and Apostles\\n\\n[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[Russell](Bertrand)(Bertrand Russell), 1907]]\\n\\nIn 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [Moral Sciences Club](Cambridge)(Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club), an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29&nbsp;November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as }}He dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.\\n\\nThe club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25&nbsp;October 1946 at [Braithwaite](Richard)(R. B. Braithwaite)\\'s rooms in [College, Cambridge](King\\'s)(King\\'s College, Cambridge), where [Popper](Karl)(Karl Popper), another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper\\'s paper was \"Are there philosophical problems?\", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein\\'s, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one – \"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers\" – at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein \"stormed out\", but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the 20th CE, were ever in the same room together. The minutes record that the meeting was }}\\n\\n### Cambridge Apostles\\n\\nThe economist [Maynard Keynes](John)(John Maynard Keynes) also invited him to join the [Apostles](Cambridge)(Cambridge Apostles), an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Bertrand Russell and [E. Moore](G.)(G. E. Moore) had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not greatly enjoy it and attended only infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group\\'s raucous style of intellectual debate, its precious sense of humour, and the fact that the members were often in love with one another. He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the style of discussion. Nevertheless, the Cambridge Apostles allowed Wittgenstein to participate in meetings again in the 1920s when he had returned to [Cambridge](Cambridge). Reportedly, Wittgenstein also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club.\\n\\n### Frustrations at Cambridge\\n\\nWittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad. Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he \"felt the curse of those who have half a talent\". He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work. Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair. Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: }} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell\\'s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell\\'s rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left. Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig\\'s temperament was also recorded in the diary of [Pinsent](David)(David Pinsent). Pinsent writes  and  when talking about Wittgenstein\\'s emotional fluctuations.\\n\\n### Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent\\n\\n[[with friends drinking coffee.jpg|thumb|right|Wittgenstein sitting with his friends and family in Vienna. Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place](File:Wittgenstein)]\\n\\nWittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [Hume Pinsent](David)(David Pinsent) in 1912, [Skinner](Francis)(Francis Skinner) in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s. He later claimed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman. Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, sculpting a bust modelled on her and seriously considering marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children;  she decided that he was not right for her.\\n\\n[[File:15. David Pinsent.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[Pinsent](David)(David Pinsent)]]\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s relationship with David Pinsent occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. Pinsent was a mathematics undergraduate and a relation of [Hume](David)(David Hume), and Wittgenstein and he soon became very close. The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [Psychological Association](British)(British Psychological Society) in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [class travel](first)(first class travel), the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. In determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search of a location that would fulfill the following criteria: a small village located on a fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law. Choosing [Øystese](Øystese), Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. During a vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his notion of leaving Cambridge and returning to Norway to continue his work on logic. Pinsent\\'s diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein\\'s personality: sensitive, nervous, and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent. Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being \"absolutely sulky and snappish\" at times, as well. In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity.  Most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein\\'s aesthetics: }}He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: }}The last time they saw each other was on 8&nbsp;October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: back to Cambridgeas he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7:00to catch a 7:30&nbsp; train from New Street Station. It was sad parting from him.}}Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.\\n\\n## 1913–1920: World War I and the *Tractatus*\\n\\n### Work on *Logik*\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|Entries from October 1914 in Wittgenstein\\'s diary, on display at the [Library](Wren)(Wren Library), [College, Cambridge](Trinity)(Trinity College, Cambridge)]]\\n\\nKarl Wittgenstein died on 20&nbsp;January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe. He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [Maria Rilke](Rainer)(Rainer Maria Rilke) and [Trakl](Georg)(Georg Trakl). Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [Skjolden](Skjolden) in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing *Logik* (*Notes on Logic*), the predecessor of much of the *Tractatus*.\\n\\nWhile in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [Norwegian](Norwegian language) to converse with the local villagers, and [Danish](Danish language) to read the works of the Danish philosopher [Kierkegaard](Søren)(Søren Kierkegaard). He adored the \"quiet seriousness\" of the landscape but even Skjolden became too busy for him. He soon designed a small wooden house which was erected on a remote rock overlooking the Eidsvatnet Lake just outside the village. The place was called \"Østerrike\" (Austria) by locals. He lived there during various periods until the 1930s, and substantial parts of his works were written there. (The house was broken up in 1958 to be rebuilt in the village. A local foundation collected donations and bought it in 2014; it was dismantled again and re-erected at its original location; the inauguration took place on 20&nbsp;June 2019 with international attendance.)\\n\\nIt was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in *Notes on Logic*, a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that }}Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.\\n\\nThe problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, }}The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live. Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the *Tractatus*. The *Tractatus* does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, }}This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.\\n\\nAt Wittgenstein\\'s insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [Edmonds](David)(David Edmonds (philosopher)) and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with *\"absolutely no intelligence whatever.\"* In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein\\'s secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong. When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting *Logik* as sufficient for a bachelor\\'s degree, but they refused, saying it wasn\\'t formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May&nbsp;1914: }}Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head. The two did not speak again until 1929.\\n\\n### Military service\\n\\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-073-25, Isonzo-Schlacht, Trainkolonne am Moistroka-Pass.jpg|thumb|upright|Austro-Hungarian supply line over the [Pass](Vršič)(Vršič Pass), on the [front](Italian)(Italian Campaign (World War I)), October&nbsp;1917]]\\n\\nOn the outbreak of World War&nbsp;I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [Army](Austro-Hungarian)(Austro-Hungarian Army), despite being eligible for a medical exemption. He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop \"several miles from the action\". He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [Kraków](Kraków). In March&nbsp;1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [7th&nbsp;Army](Austrian)(7th Army (Austria-Hungary)), where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [Offensive](Brusilov)(Brusilov Offensive). Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man\\'s land against Allied troopsone of the most dangerous jobs, since he was targeted by enemy fire. He was decorated with the [Merit](Military)(Military Merit Medal (Austria–Hungary)) with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for \"exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism\" that \"won the total admiration of the troops\". In January&nbsp;1917, he was sent as a member of a [howitzer](howitzer) regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [Medal for Valour](Silver)(Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)), First Class. In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [front](Italian)(Italian Campaign (World War I)) as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June&nbsp;1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swordsit being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War.jpg|thumb|upright|Wittgenstein\\'s military identity card during the First World War](File:27.)]\\n\\nThroughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers. His notebooks also attest to his philosophical and spiritual reflections, and it was during this time that he experienced a kind of religious awakening. In his entry from 11 June 1915, Wittgenstein states that }} and on 8 July that }}  He discovered [Tolstoy](Leo)(Leo Tolstoy)\\'s 1896 *[Gospel in Brief](The)(The Gospel in Brief)* at a bookshop in [Tarnów](Tarnów), and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as \"the man with the gospels\".\\n\\nThe extent to which *The Gospel in Brief* influenced Wittgenstein can be seen in the *Tractatus*, in the unique way both books number their sentences. In 1916 Wittgenstein read [Dostoevsky](Dostoevsky)\\'s *[Brothers Karamazov](The)(The Brothers Karamazov)* so often that he knew whole passages of it by heart, particularly the speeches of the elder Zosima, who represented for him a powerful Christian ideal, a holy man \"who could see directly into the souls of other people\".\\n\\n[King](Iain)(Iain King) has suggested that Wittgenstein\\'s writing changed substantially in 1916, when he started confronting much greater dangers during frontline fighting. Russell said he returned from the war a changed man, one with a deeply [mystical](mystical) and [ascetic](ascetic) attitude.\\n\\n### Completion of the *Tractatus*\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein family Vienna 1917.jpg|thumb|left|The Wittgenstein family in [Vienna](Vienna), Summer&nbsp;1917, with Kurt (furthest left) and Ludwig (furthest right) in officers\\' uniforms.]]\\n\\nIn the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family\\'s Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August&nbsp;1918 that he completed the *Tractatus*, which he submitted with the title *Der Satz* (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also \"leap\") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.\\n\\nA series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13&nbsp;August, his uncle Paul died. On 25&nbsp;October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the *Tractatus*, and on 27&nbsp;October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent\\'s mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8&nbsp;May. Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by [forces](Allied)(Allies of World War I) on 3&nbsp;November in [Trentino](Trentino). He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.\\n\\nHe returned to his family in Vienna on 25&nbsp;August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000&nbsp;[Kronen](Austro-Hungarian krone) a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [States](United)(United States) and the [Netherlands](Netherlands). He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.\\n\\n## 1920–1928: Teaching, the *Tractatus*, Haus Wittgenstein\\n\\n### Teacher training in Vienna\\n\\nIn September&nbsp;1919 he enrolled in the *Lehrerbildungsanstalt* (teacher training college) in the *Kundmanngasse* in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere. [Bernhard](Thomas)(Thomas Bernhard), more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein\\'s life: \"the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity.\"\\n\\n### Teaching posts in Austria\\n\\nIn the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: }}\\n\\nIn 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [Trattenbach](Trattenbach), under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October&nbsp;1921, he wrote to Russell: \"I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere.\" He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students \"literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations.\"\\n\\nTo the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror. They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls\\' hair; this was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting \"Krautsalat!\" (\"coleslaw\" – i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and \"Nonsense!\" when a priest was answering children\\'s questions.\\n\\n### Publication of the *Tractatus*\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, [schoolteacher](schoolteacher), c. 1922]]\\n\\nWhile Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the *[Tractatus](Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus)* was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as *Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung*, part of [Ostwald](Wilhelm)(Wilhelm Ostwald)\\'s journal *Annalen der Naturphilosophie*, though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy. In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote \"The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s – i.e. by language – (and, which comes to the same thing, what can be *thought*) and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy.\" But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell\\'s help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the *Tractatus*.\\n\\nAn English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [Ramsey](Frank)(Frank P. Ramsey), a mathematics undergraduate at King\\'s commissioned by [K. Ogden](C.)(C. K. Ogden). It was Moore who suggested *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* for the title, an allusion to [Spinoza](Baruch)(Baruch Spinoza)\\'s *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.* Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell\\'s introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell\\'s introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation. This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein\\'s English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [Pears](David)(David Pears) and [McGuinness](Brian)(Brian McGuinness).\\n\\n* For a discussion about the relative merits of the translations, see  and\\n\\n* See the three versions (Wittgenstein\\'s German, published 1921; Ramsey-Ogden\\'s translation, published 1922; and the Pears & McGuinness translation, published 1961) side by side:  }}\\n\\nAn aim of the *Tractatus* is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: \"What we can say at all can be said clearly,\" he argues. Anything beyond that – religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical – cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: \"The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather – not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\"*Tractatus* (Ogden translation), preface.\\n\\nThe book is 75&nbsp;pages long – \"As to the shortness of the book, I am *awfully sorry for it* ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me,\" he told Ogden – and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):\\n\\n# *Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist*.\\n\\n#: The world is everything that is the case.The English is from the original Ogden/Ramsey translation.\\n\\n# *Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten*.\\n\\n#: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of [fact](atomic)(atomic fact)s.\\n\\n# *Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke*.\\n\\n#: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\\n\\n# *Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz*.\\n\\n#: The thought is the significant proposition.\\n\\n# *Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze*.\\n\\n#: Propositions are truth-functions of [proposition](elementary)(elementary proposition)s.\\n\\n# *Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: [p,\\\\bar\\\\xi, N(\\\\bar\\\\xi)](\\\\bar). Dies ist die allgemeine Form des Satzes*.\\n\\n#: The general form of a truth-function is: [p,\\\\bar\\\\xi, N(\\\\bar\\\\xi)](\\\\bar). This is the general form of proposition.\\n\\n# *Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen*.\\n\\n#: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\\n\\n### Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg\\n\\n[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|thumb|upright|[P. Ramsey](Frank)(Frank P. Ramsey) visited Wittgenstein in [am Schneeberg](Puchberg)(Puchberg am Schneeberg) in September 1923.]]\\n\\nIn September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, [Hassbach](Hassbach (Lower Austria)), but considered the people there just as bad – \"These people are not human *at all* but loathsome worms,\" he wrote to a friend – and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [Puchberg](Puchberg am Schneeberg) in the [Schneeberg](Schneeberg (Alps)) mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were \"one-quarter animal and three-quarters human.\"\\n\\n[P. Ramsey](Frank)(Frank P. Ramsey) visited him on 17&nbsp;September 1923 to discuss the *Tractatus*; he had agreed to write a review of it for *Mind*. He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, a washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein\\'s school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein\\'s friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to [Maynard Keynes](John)(John Maynard Keynes): }}\\n\\n### Teaching continues, Otterthal; Haidbauer incident\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|Wittgenstein, 1925](File:31.)]\\n\\nHe moved schools again in September&nbsp;1924, this time to [Otterthal](Otterthal), near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, *Wörterbuch für Volksschulen*, published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the *Tractatus* that was published in his lifetime. A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000. In 2020, an English version entitled *Word Book* translated by art historian Bettina Funcke and illustrated by artist / publisher [Chan](Paul)(Paul Chan (artist)) was released.\\n\\nAn incident occurred in April&nbsp;1926 and became known as *Der Vorfall Haidbauer* (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster\\'s office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer\\'s daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled. Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: }}Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village\\'s police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over. Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August&nbsp;1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein\\'s family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [leukaemia](leukaemia).\\n\\nTen years later, in 1936, as part of a series of \"confessions\" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a \"Ja, ja,\" though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was notOf the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, }}\\n\\n### The Vienna Circle\\n\\nThe *Tractatus* was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [Circle](Vienna)(Vienna Circle), had built up purportedly as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the *Tractatus*. While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [Hanfling](Oswald)(Oswald Hanfling) writes bluntly: \"Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time.\\n\\nYet his influence on the Circle\\'s thought was at least as important as that of any of its members.\" However, the philosopher [C. Grayling](A.)(A. C. Grayling) contends that while certain superficial similarities between Wittgenstein\\'s early philosophy and [positivism](logical)(logical positivism) led its members to study the *Tractatus* in detail and to arrange discussions with him, Wittgenstein\\'s influence on the Circle was rather limited. The fundamental philosophical views of Circle had been established before they met Wittgenstein and had their origins in the [empiricists](British)(Empiricism), [Mach](Ernst)(Ernst Mach), and the logic of [Frege](Gottlob Frege) and Russell. Whatever influence Wittgenstein did have on the Circle was largely limited to [Schlick](Moritz)(Moritz Schlick) and [Waismann](Friedrich)(Friedrich Waismann) and, even in these cases, resulted in little lasting effect on their positivism. Grayling states: \"...it is no longer possible to think of the *Tractatus* as having inspired a philosophical movement, as most earlier commentators claimed.\"\\n\\nFrom 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group\\'s misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.  In his autobiography, [Carnap](Rudolf)(Rudolf Carnap) describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that \"there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein\\'s attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems.\" As for Wittgenstein:\\n\\n}}\\n\\n### Haus Wittgenstein\\n\\n[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wittgenstein worked on [Wittgenstein](Haus)(Haus Wittgenstein) between 1926 and 1929.]]\\n\\n}}\\n\\nIn 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna\\'s *Kundmanngasse*. Wittgenstein, his friend [Engelmann](Paul)(Paul Engelmann), and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30&nbsp;mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that \"This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.\"\\n\\nIt took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed , moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of *The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein*, said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \"It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor.\"\\n\\nThe house was finished by December&nbsp;1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein\\'s sister Hermine wrote: \"Even though I admired the house very much. ... It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods.\" Wittgenstein said \"the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and *good* manners, and expression of great *understanding*... But *primordial* life, wild life striving to erupt into the open – that is lacking.\" Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this \"wild life striving to be in the open\" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein\\'s philosophical work.\\n\\n## 1929–1941: Fellowship at Cambridge\\n\\n### PhD and fellowship\\n\\n[[Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930](File:Ludwig)]\\n\\nAccording to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician [E. J. Brouwer](L.)(L. E. J. Brouwer), Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a \"return to Philosophy\". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.\" Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the *Tractatus* as his thesis.Alan Wood (1957). *Bertrand Russell: The Passionate Sceptic.* (London: Allen and Unwin). p. 156 It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, \\'\"Don\\'t worry, I know you\\'ll never understand it.\" Moore wrote in the examiner\\'s report: \"I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree.\"}} Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College.\\n\\n### Anschluss\\n\\n[[File:21. Photographs showing Wittgenstein’s house in Norway.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Photograph showing Wittgenstein\\'s house in Norway, sent by Wittgenstein to [E. Moore](G.)(G. E. Moore), October&nbsp;1936]]\\n\\nFrom 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway, where he worked on the *Philosophical Investigations*. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of \"confessions\" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [O\\'Connor Drury](Maurice)(Maurice O\\'Connor Drury), a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [Taoiseach](Taoiseach), [de Valera](Éamon)(Éamon de Valera), himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein\\'s presence would contribute to the [Institute for Advanced Studies](Dublin)(Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies) which he was soon to set up.\\n\\nWhile he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the *Anschluss*; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a Jew under the [Nuremberg racial laws](1935)(Nuremberg Laws), because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. He would also, in July, become by law a citizen of the enlarged Germany.\\n\\nThe Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (*Volljuden*) if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (*[Mischling](Mischling)*) if they had one or two. It meant *inter alia* that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.\\n\\nAfter the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer\\'s daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for *[Rassenschande](Rassenschande)* (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.\\n\\nWittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.\\n\\nA few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted *Mischling* status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12. Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family\\'s large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July&nbsp;1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.\\n\\n### Professor of philosophy\\n\\nAfter [E. Moore](G.)(G. E. Moore) resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected. He was naturalised as a [subject](British)(British subject) shortly after on 12 April 1939. In July&nbsp;1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the [Reichsbank](Reichsbank). After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required *Befreiung* was granted in August&nbsp;1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets 1,700&nbsp;kg of gold. There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [Janowskaya](Sophia)(Sofya Yanovskaya).\\n\\n[Malcolm](Norman)(Norman Malcolm), at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: }}\\n\\nDescribing Wittgenstein\\'s lecture programme, Malcolm continues: }}\\n\\nAfter work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [Westerns](Western Movie), where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [Davis](Norbert)(Norbert Davis). Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.\\n\\nBy this time, Wittgenstein\\'s view on the [of mathematics](foundations)(foundations of mathematics) had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [Whitehead](Alfred North Whitehead)\\'s *[Mathematica](Principia)(Principia Mathematica)*. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [Turing](Alan)(Alan Turing) who described Wittgenstein as *\"a *very* peculiar man\"*. The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s lectures from this period have also been discussed by another of his students, the Greek philosopher and educator [Lambridis](Helle)(Elli Lambridi). Wittgenstein\\'s teachings in the years 1940–1941 are used in the mid-1950s by Lambridis to write a long text in the form of an imagined dialogue with him, where she begins to develop her own ideas about resemblance in relation to language, elementary concepts and basic-level mental images. Initially only a part of it was published in 1963 in the German education theory review *Club Voltaire*, but the entire imagined dialogue with Wittgenstein was published after Lambridis\\'s death by her archive holder, the [of Athens](Academy)(Academy of Athens (modern)), in 2004.\\n\\n## 1941–1947: Guy\\'s Hospital and Royal Victoria Infirmary\\n\\nMonk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war ([War II](World)(World War II)) was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers..}}\\n\\nIn September&nbsp;1941, he asked [Ryle](John)(John Ryle (professor)), the brother of the philosopher [Ryle](Gilbert)(Gilbert Ryle), if he could get a manual job at [Hospital](Guy\\'s)(Guy\\'s Hospital) in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy\\'s prepare for [Blitz](the)(the Blitz). Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy\\'s shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them. In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been determined to meet him. His son recorded the weekend in his diary;}} The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world\\'s most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him – at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings – but they were discreet. \"Good God, don\\'t tell anybody who I am!\" Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1&nbsp;April 1942: \"I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless.\" It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy\\'s to remove a [gallstone](gallstone) that had troubled him for some years.\\n\\nHe had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [Skinner](Francis)(Francis Skinner), the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner\\'s death in 1941 from [polio](polio). Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein\\'s influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [and Guilds](City)(City and Guilds) exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy\\'s he wrote in his diary: \"For ten days I\\'ve heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A *tragic* thought!\" Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.\\n\\nWhile Wittgenstein was at Guy\\'s he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of wound shock (a state associative to [hypovolaemia](hypovolaemia)) on air-raid casualties. When the Blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November&nbsp;1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [Victoria Infirmary](Royal)(Royal Victoria Infirmary), [upon Tyne](Newcastle)(Newcastle upon Tyne), to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28&nbsp;Brandling Park, [Jesmond](Jesmond)) from 29&nbsp;April 1943 until February&nbsp;1944. While there he worked\\n\\nand associated socially with Dr [Barlow](Erasmus)(Erasmus Darwin Barlow), a great-grandson of [Darwin](Charles)(Charles Darwin).\\n\\nIn the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [*Mind*](Mind (journal)). It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards, writing in his diary, \"The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background.\" On 30&nbsp;September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, \"Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me.\"\\n\\nWittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre, from Guy\\'s hospital, who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.\\n\\nIn May&nbsp;1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [Descartes\\'](René Descartes) *[ergo sum](Cogito)(Cogito ergo sum)*, where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [Arthur Prichard](Harold)(Harold Arthur Prichard) who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein\\'s methods;}}\\n\\n## 1947–1951: Final years\\n\\nWittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to [Ireland](Ireland), staying at Ross\\'s Hotel in [Dublin](Dublin) and at a farmhouse in [Redcross](Redcross), [Wicklow](County)(County Wicklow), where he began the manuscript MS&nbsp;137, volume&nbsp;R. Seeking solitude he moved to a holiday cottage in Rosroe overlooking [Harbour](Killary)(Killary Harbour), [Connemara](Connemara) owned by Drury\\'s brother.\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein plaque, National Botanic Gardens, Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque in the [Botanic Gardens, Dublin](National)(National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)), commemorating Wittgenstein\\'s visits in the winter of 1948–1949.]]\\n\\nHe also accepted an invitation from Norman Malcolm, then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [New York](Ithaca,)(Ithaca, New York). He made the trip in April&nbsp;1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: \"I haven\\'t done any work since the beginning of March & I haven\\'t had the strength of even trying to do any.\" A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein\\'s stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm\\'s *Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir*.}} During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [scepticism](philosophical)(philosophical scepticism), that would eventually become the final fragments *[Certainty](On)(On Certainty)*.\\n\\n[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey\\'s Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at \"Storey\\'s End\", 76&nbsp;[Way](Storey\\'s)(Storey\\'s Way), Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]\\n\\nHe returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [cancer](prostate)(prostate cancer), which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11&nbsp;February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. \"Great loss for me and all of us,\" he wrote. \"Greater than I would have thought.\" He moved around a lot after Hermine\\'s death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April&nbsp;1950, where he stayed with [von&nbsp;Wright](G.H.)(Georg Henrik von Wright); to London to stay with [Rhees](Rush)(Rush Rhees); then to Oxford to see [Anscombe](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Anscombe), writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27&nbsp;November he moved into \\'\\'Storey\\'s End\\'\\' at 76&nbsp;[Way](Storey\\'s)(Storey\\'s Way), the home of his doctor, [Bevan](Edward)(Edward Vaughan Bevan), and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.\\n\\nBy the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29&nbsp;January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von&nbsp;Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, \"My mind\\'s completely dead. This isn\\'t a complaint, for I don\\'t really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does.\" In February, he returned to the Bevans\\' home to work on MS&nbsp;175 and MS&nbsp;176. These and other manuscripts were later published as *[on Colour](Remarks)(Remarks on Colour)* and *[Certainty](On)(On Certainty)*. He wrote to Malcolm on 16&nbsp;April, 13&nbsp;days before his death:\\n\\n}}\\n\\n### Death\\n\\n[[bed.jpg|thumb|right|Wittgenstein on his deathbed, 1951](File:Death)]\\n\\n[[notice Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|left|Death notice issued by Ludwig\\'s family](File:Death)]\\n\\nWittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS&nbsp;177, on 25&nbsp;April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26&nbsp;April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27&nbsp;April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, \"Good!\". Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28&nbsp;April, he told her: \"Tell them I\\'ve had a wonderful life.\" Norman Malcolm describes this as a \"strangely moving utterance\".\\n\\nFour of Wittgenstein\\'s former students arrived at his bedside – Ben Richards, [Anscombe](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Anscombe), [Smythies](Yorick)(Yorick Smythies), and [O\\'Connor Drury](Maurice)(Maurice O\\'Connor Drury). Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter\\'s request, a Dominican friar, Father [Pepler](Conrad)(Conrad Pepler), also attended. (Wittgenstein had asked for a \"priest who was not a philosopher\" and had met with Pepler several times before his death.) They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone 2021.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein\\'s grave at the [Parish Burial Ground](Ascension)(Ascension Parish Burial Ground) in [Cambridge](Cambridge)]]\\n\\nWittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at [Parish Burial Ground](Ascension)(Ascension Parish Burial Ground) in Cambridge.A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr.&nbsp;[Goldie](Mark)(Mark Goldie) (2009), pages&nbsp;62–63 Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do. In 2015 the ledger gravestone was refurbished by the British Wittgenstein Society.\\n\\nOn his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [Catholicism](Catholicism), and was sympathetic to it, but did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein saw Catholicism more as a way of life than as a set of beliefs he held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith. }}\\n\\n}}\\n\\nWittgenstein was said by some commentators to be [agnostic](agnostic), in a qualified sense.}}\\n\\n; cf. .}}\\n\\n## 1953: Publication of the *Philosophical Investigations*\\n\\n[[File:Kaninchen und Ente.png|thumb|Illustration of a \"[duckrabbit](Rabbit–duck illusion)\", discussed in the *Philosophical Investigations*, section XI, part II]]\\n\\nThe *[Book](Blue)(Blue and Brown Books)\\'\\', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein\\'s later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning point in his philosophy of language.\\n\\n*Philosophical Investigations* was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part&nbsp;II was added by his editors, [Anscombe](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth Anscombe) and [Rhees](Rush)(Rush Rhees). Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers\\' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar — what he called \"language gone on holiday\".*PI*, §&nbsp;38.\\n\\nAccording to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.*PI*, §&nbsp;107. Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the \"rough ground\" of ordinary language in use. Much of the *Investigations* consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: \"The clarity we are aiming at is indeed *complete* clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should *completely* disappear.\"*PI*, §&nbsp;133.\\n\\n## Other posthumous publications\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s archive of unpublished papers included 83&nbsp;manuscripts, 46&nbsp;typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000&nbsp;pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections, and loose notes, editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print. An Internet facility hosted by the [of Bergen](University)(University of Bergen) allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions. In 2011, two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers, thought to have been lost during the Second World War, were found.\\n\\nWhat became the *[Investigations](Philosophical)(Philosophical Investigations)* was already close to completion in 1951. Wittgenstein\\'s three literary executors prioritized it, both because of its intrinsic importance and because he had explicitly intended publication. The book was published in 1953.\\n\\nAt least three other works were more or less finished. Two were already \"bulky typescripts\", the *Philosophical Remarks* and *Philosophical Grammar*. Literary (co-)executor G. H. von Wright stated, \"They are virtually completed works. But Wittgenstein did not publish them.\" The third was *Remarks on Colour*. \"He wrote *[i.a.](inter alia)* a fair amount on colour concepts, and this material he did excerpt and polish, reducing it to a small compass.\"\\n\\n## Legacy\\n\\n### Assessment\\n\\n[[File:Wittgenstein-monumentet nær filosofens hytte i Norge.jpg|thumb|The \"Wittgenstein Monument\" in [Skjolden](Skjolden), Norway, erected near the philosopher\\'s hut in 2018 by artists Sebastian Kjølaas, Marianne Bredesen and Siri Hjorth. The \"hand-mouth\" pine monument can also speak and whistle.]]\\n\\n[Russell](Bertrand)(Bertrand Russell) described Wittgenstein as }}\\n\\nAs mentioned above, in 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the *Investigations* as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as \"the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations.\" The *Investigations* also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the [of Minnesota](University)(University of Minnesota)\\'s Center for Cognitive Sciences.\\n\\nDuncan J. Richter of the [Military Institute](Virginia)(Virginia Military Institute), writing for the *[Encyclopedia of Philosophy](Internet)(Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)*, has described Wittgenstein as \"one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, and regarded by some as the most important since [Kant](Immanuel)(Immanuel Kant).\" [Hacker](Peter)(Peter Hacker) argues that Wittgenstein\\'s influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the [Circle](Vienna)(Vienna Circle) and later influence on the Oxford [language\" school](\"ordinary)(Ordinary language philosophy) and Cambridge philosophers.\\n\\nHe is considered by some to be one of the greatest philosophers of the modern era.\\n\\nBut despite its deep influence on analytical philosophy, Wittgenstein\\'s work did not always gain a positive reception. Argentine-Canadian philosopher [Bunge](Mario)(Mario Bunge) considers that \"Wittgenstein is popular\\n\\nbecause he is trivial.\" In\\n\\nBunge\\'s opinion, Wittgenstein\\'s philosophy is trivial because it deals with unimportant\\n\\nproblems and ignores science. According to Bunge, Wittgenstein\\'s\\n\\nphilosophy of language is shallow because it ignores [linguistics](scientific)(linguistics). Bunge also considers Wittgenstein\\'s philosophy of mind to be speculative because it is not informed by the scientific research performed in [psychology](psychology).\\n\\n### Scholarly interpretation\\n\\nThere are many diverging interpretations of Wittgenstein\\'s thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [Henrik von Wright](Georg)(Georg Henrik von Wright): }}\\n\\nSince Wittgenstein\\'s death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between the so-called **early Wittgenstein** and the so-called **late**(**r**) **Wittgenstein** (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the *Tractatus* and those in *Philosophical Investigations*), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein\\'s unpublished papers (the *[Nachlass](Nachlass)*).\\n\\n#### The New Wittgenstein\\n\\nOne significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [New Wittgenstein](The)(The New Wittgenstein) school such as [Diamond](Cora)(Cora Diamond), [Crary](Alice)(Alice Crary), and [F. Conant](James)(James F. Conant).  While the *Tractatus*, particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a \"[therapeutic](therapeutic approach)\" understanding of Wittgenstein\\'s work – \"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.\" To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the *Tractatus* as \"plain nonsense\" – arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [Wisdom](John)(John Wisdom) and the review of *The Blue Book* written by [Kolk Bouwsma](Oets)(Oets Kolk Bouwsma).\\n\\nThe therapeutic approach is not without critics: [Glock](Hans-Johann)(Hans-Johann Glock) argues that the \"plain nonsense\" reading of the *Tractatus* \"is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the *Tractatus* is committed to the idea of ineffable insight.\"\\n\\n[Sluga](Hans)(Hans Sluga) and [Read](Rupert)(Rupert Read) have advocated a \"post-[therapeutic](Therapeutic approach)\" or \"liberatory\" interpretation of Wittgenstein.\\n\\n#### Bertrand Russell\\n\\nIn October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as did Russell, who had been living in the United States for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell\\'s works to Drury:}}Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein\\'s later work:}}\\n\\n#### Saul Kripke\\n\\n[Kripke](Saul)(Saul Kripke)\\'s 1982 book *[on Rules and Private Language](Wittgenstein)(Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language)* contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein\\'s *[Investigations](Philosophical)(Philosophical Investigations)* is a devastating [paradox](rule-following)(rule-following paradox) that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is \"the most radical and original sceptical problem that philosophy has seen to date.\"\\n\\nKripke\\'s book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his sceptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [McDowell](John)(John McDowell), [Cavell](Stanley)(Stanley Cavell), [Baker](Gordon)(Gordon Baker), [Hacker](Peter)(Peter Hacker), [McGinn](Colin)(Colin McGinn), and [Winch](Peter)(Peter Winch) who argue that his scepticism of meaning is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke\\'s position has, however, recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [Kusch](Martin)(Martin Kusch) (2006).\\n\\n## Works\\n\\nA collection of Ludwig Wittgenstein\\'s manuscripts is held by Trinity College, Cambridge.\\n\\n* *Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung*, Annalen der Naturphilosophie, 14 (1921)\\n\\n** *[Logico-Philosophicus](Tractatus)(Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus)* [*TLP*], translated by [K.

       "  'answer': 'Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was an Austrian-born philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, particularly in the areas of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. Born into a wealthy and culturally vibrant family in Vienna, Wittgenstein\\'s early life was marked by both privilege and personal tragedy, with several siblings dying by suicide. Initially trained in engineering, Wittgenstein\\'s intellectual journey led him to Cambridge, where, under the guidance of Bertrand Russell, he shifted his focus to philosophy, quickly establishing himself as a brilliant and original thinker.\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s philosophical work is commonly divided into two distinct periods. His early philosophy, captured in the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1921), sought to outline the logical structure connecting language and reality, positing that what can be meaningfully said must be capable of clear expression, and that anything beyond this—such as ethics, aesthetics, and religion—belongs to the realm of the unsayable. After a period away from academia, during which he worked as a schoolteacher and engaged in various non-academic pursuits, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge and developed his later philosophy, most notably presented in *Philosophical Investigations* (1953, published posthumously). In this later work, he abandoned the rigid logical structure of the *Tractatus*, arguing instead that the meaning of language arises from its public use within various \"language games,\" thus emphasizing the contextual and social nature of meaning and dissolving many traditional philosophical problems.\\n\\nWittgenstein\\'s life was as unconventional as his ideas. He gave away his inherited fortune, served bravely in World War I, and often withdrew from academic life to seek solitude or engage in manual labor. Despite publishing only one philosophical book during his lifetime, his extensive unpublished manuscripts and posthumous works have had a profound impact on analytic philosophy, influencing figures such as the Vienna Circle, ordinary language philosophers, and later thinkers like Saul Kripke. Wittgenstein\\'s legacy is debated: some hail him as the greatest philosopher since Kant, while others criticize his work as excessively focused on linguistic puzzles. Nevertheless, his innovative approach to the problems of language, meaning, and philosophy continues to shape contemporary thought.',\n",

      "**Samuel Moore Walton** (March 29, 1918 – April 5, 1992)\n",
      "\n",
      "was an American [magnate](business)(business magnate) best known for founding the retailers [Walmart](Walmart) and [Club](Sam's)(Sam's Club), which he started in 1962 and 1983 respectively. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the [States](United)(United States). [family](His)(Walton family) has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in [Oklahoma](Kingfisher,)(Kingfisher, Oklahoma). He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for [Life](Metropolitan)(Metropolitan Life) Insurance, where he [foreclosed](foreclosure) on farms during the [Depression](Great)(Great Depression).\n",
      "\n",
      "He and his family (now with another son, [James](James \"Bud\" Walton), born in 1921) moved from [Oklahoma](Oklahoma). They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in [Missouri](Shelbina,)(Shelbina, Missouri), Sam became the youngest [Scout](Eagle)(Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)) in the state's history. In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the [Eagle Scout Award](Distinguished)(Distinguished Eagle Scout Award) from the [Scouts of America](Boy)(Boy Scouts of America).\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually the family moved to [Missouri](Columbia,)(Columbia, Missouri). Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver *[Daily Tribune](Columbia)(Columbia Daily Tribune)* newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions. Upon graduating from [H. Hickman High School](David)(David H. Hickman High School) in Columbia, he was voted \"Most Versatile Boy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "[[in his high school yearbook, 1936](File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|Walton)]\n",
      "\n",
      "After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the [of Missouri](University)(University of Missouri) as an [ROTC](ROTC) cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the [Phi](Zeta)(Zeta Phi) chapter of [Theta Pi](Beta)(Beta Theta Pi) fraternity. He was also tapped by [QEBH](QEBH), the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society [and Blade](Scabbard)(Scabbard and Blade). Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and [College](Stephens)(Stephens College). Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted \"permanent president\" of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton joined [C. Penney](J.)(J. C. Penney) as a management trainee in [Moines, Iowa](Des)(Des Moines, Iowa), three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in [War II](World)(World War II). In the meantime, he worked at a [DuPont](DuPont) munitions plant near [Oklahoma](Tulsa,)(Tulsa, Oklahoma). Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the [Army Intelligence Corps](U.S.)(Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)), supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at [Douglas](Fort)(Fort Douglas, Utah) in [Lake City](Salt)(Salt Lake City), [Utah](Utah). He eventually reached the rank of [captain](Captain (United States O-3)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## The first stores\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a [Franklin](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)) variety store in [Arkansas](Newport,)(Newport, Arkansas). The store was a franchise of the [Brothers](Butler)(Butler Brothers) chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny \"Eagle\" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called \"a fair price\".Walton & Huey, *Made in America: My Story*, p. 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Five and Dime store, Bentonville, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|left|Walton's Five and Dime, now the Walmart Historical Museum, Bentonville.](File:Walton's)]\n",
      "\n",
      "With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of [Arkansas](Bentonville,)(Bentonville, Arkansas). Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "## A chain of Ben Franklin stores\n",
      "\n",
      "With the new Bentonville \"Five and Dime\" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the [baby boom](postwar)(Post–World War II baby boom) in full effect), Walton became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more [Franklin franchises](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)). (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother [\"Bud\" Walton](James)(James \"Bud\" Walton) having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son [John](John T. Walton) would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1954, he opened a store with his brother [Bud](James \"Bud\" Walton) in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of [City, Missouri](Kansas)(Kansas City, Missouri). With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklin's and one independent, in Fayetteville).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## First Walmart\n",
      "\n",
      "The first true [Walmart](Walmart) opened on July 2, 1962, in [Arkansas](Rogers,)(Rogers, Arkansas). Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the [Meijer](Meijer) store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer's original innovative concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton's model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make his model work, he emphasized [logistics](logistics), particularly locating stores within a day's drive of Walmart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growthfrom 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800was achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given its scale and economic influence, Walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store. These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the \"Walmart Effect\".\n",
      "\n",
      "## Personal life\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton married [Robson](Helen)(Helen Walton) on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: [Robson (Rob)](Samuel)(Samuel Robson Walton) born in 1944, [Thomas](John)(John Thomas Walton) (1946–2005), [Carr (Jim)](James)(James Carr Walton) born in 1948, and [Louise](Alice)(Alice Louise Walton) born in 1949.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students. The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of “service leadership” into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of [Christ](Jesus) being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in [Christianity](Christianity).\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton was diagnosed and treated for [cell leukemia](Hairy)(Hairy cell leukemia).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Death\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton  died on Sunday, April 5, 1992 (three months shy of Walmart's thirtieth anniversary), of [myeloma](multiple)(multiple myeloma), a type of blood cancer, in [Rock, Arkansas](Little)(Little Rock, Arkansas). The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Walmart stores. At the time, his company employed 400,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50&nbsp;billion flowed from 1,735 Walmarts, 212 Sam's Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: [Walton](Rob)(S. Robson Walton) succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and [Walton](John)(John T. Walton) was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son [Walton](Jim)(Jim Walton) is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother [Walton](Bud)(Bud Walton)&mdash;[Kroenke](Ann)(Ann Walton Kroenke) and [Laurie](Nancy)(Nancy Walton Laurie)&mdash;hold smaller shares in the company.\n",

      "Completion: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sam Walton, born in 1918 in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, rose from humble beginnings during the Great Depression to become one of America\\'s most influential business figures. After assisting with family finances through various odd jobs as a youth and graduating from the University of Missouri with a degree in economics, Walton served as a captain in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps during World War II. After the war, he used his savings and a loan from his father-in-law to purchase a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas, laying the foundation for his groundbreaking retail career.\\n\\nWalton applied innovative strategies to his stores, such as aggressive pricing, well-stocked shelves, and involving store managers as equity partners to drive growth and loyalty. These practices led to the successful expansion of his business throughout Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas. In 1962, he opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, pioneering the concept of large discount stores in small towns, rather than major cities. Through logistics innovations and a relentless focus on cost control, Walton rapidly grew Walmart into the world’s largest corporation by revenue with a wide international presence, creating what became known as the \"Walmart Effect\" on local economies.\\n\\nBeyond his business achievements, Walton was a committed family man and philanthropist, incorporating principles of Christian service into Walmart\\'s culture. He died in 1992 from multiple myeloma, leaving the bulk of his fortune and business legacy to his family, who have remained among the richest in the United States. Walton’s legacy endures through Walmart’s continued global influence, the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, and accolades such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom and inclusion in Time’s most influential people of the 20th century.'}]\n"

      "**Samuel Moore Walton** (March 29, 1918 – April 5, 1992)\n",
      "\n",
      "was an American [magnate](business)(business magnate) best known for founding the retailers [Walmart](Walmart) and [Club](Sam's)(Sam's Club), which he started in 1962 and 1983 respectively. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the [States](United)(United States). [family](His)(Walton family) has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in [Oklahoma](Kingfisher,)(Kingfisher, Oklahoma). He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for [Life](Metropolitan)(Metropolitan Life) Insurance, where he [foreclosed](foreclosure) on farms during the [Depression](Great)(Great Depression).\n",
      "\n",
      "He and his family (now with another son, [James](James \"Bud\" Walton), born in 1921) moved from [Oklahoma](Oklahoma). They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in [Missouri](Shelbina,)(Shelbina, Missouri), Sam became the youngest [Scout](Eagle)(Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)) in the state's history. In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the [Eagle Scout Award](Distinguished)(Distinguished Eagle Scout Award) from the [Scouts of America](Boy)(Boy Scouts of America).\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually the family moved to [Missouri](Columbia,)(Columbia, Missouri). Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver *[Daily Tribune](Columbia)(Columbia Daily Tribune)* newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions. Upon graduating from [H. Hickman High School](David)(David H. Hickman High School) in Columbia, he was voted \"Most Versatile Boy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "[[in his high school yearbook, 1936](File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|Walton)]\n",
      "\n",
      "After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the [of Missouri](University)(University of Missouri) as an [ROTC](ROTC) cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the [Phi](Zeta)(Zeta Phi) chapter of [Theta Pi](Beta)(Beta Theta Pi) fraternity. He was also tapped by [QEBH](QEBH), the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society [and Blade](Scabbard)(Scabbard and Blade). Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and [College](Stephens)(Stephens College). Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted \"permanent president\" of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton joined [C. Penney](J.)(J. C. Penney) as a management trainee in [Moines, Iowa](Des)(Des Moines, Iowa), three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in [War II](World)(World War II). In the meantime, he worked at a [DuPont](DuPont) munitions plant near [Oklahoma](Tulsa,)(Tulsa, Oklahoma). Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the [Army Intelligence Corps](U.S.)(Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)), supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at [Douglas](Fort)(Fort Douglas, Utah) in [Lake City](Salt)(Salt Lake City), [Utah](Utah). He eventually reached the rank of [captain](Captain (United States O-3)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## The first stores\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a [Franklin](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)) variety store in [Arkansas](Newport,)(Newport, Arkansas). The store was a franchise of the [Brothers](Butler)(Butler Brothers) chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny \"Eagle\" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called \"a fair price\".Walton & Huey, *Made in America: My Story*, p. 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Five and Dime store, Bentonville, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|left|Walton's Five and Dime, now the Walmart Historical Museum, Bentonville.](File:Walton's)]\n",
      "\n",
      "With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of [Arkansas](Bentonville,)(Bentonville, Arkansas). Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "## A chain of Ben Franklin stores\n",
      "\n",
      "With the new Bentonville \"Five and Dime\" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the [baby boom](postwar)(Post–World War II baby boom) in full effect), Walton became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more [Franklin franchises](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)). (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother [\"Bud\" Walton](James)(James \"Bud\" Walton) having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son [John](John T. Walton) would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1954, he opened a store with his brother [Bud](James \"Bud\" Walton) in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of [City, Missouri](Kansas)(Kansas City, Missouri). With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklin's and one independent, in Fayetteville).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## First Walmart\n",
      "\n",
      "The first true [Walmart](Walmart) opened on July 2, 1962, in [Arkansas](Rogers,)(Rogers, Arkansas). Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the [Meijer](Meijer) store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer's original innovative concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton's model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make his model work, he emphasized [logistics](logistics), particularly locating stores within a day's drive of Walmart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growthfrom 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800was achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given its scale and economic influence, Walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store. These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the \"Walmart Effect\".\n",
      "\n",
      "## Personal life\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton married [Robson](Helen)(Helen Walton) on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: [Robson (Rob)](Samuel)(Samuel Robson Walton) born in 1944, [Thomas](John)(John Thomas Walton) (1946–2005), [Carr (Jim)](James)(James Carr Walton) born in 1948, and [Louise](Alice)(Alice Louise Walton) born in 1949.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students. The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of “service leadership” into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of [Christ](Jesus) being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in [Christianity](Christianity).\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton was diagnosed and treated for [cell leukemia](Hairy)(Hairy cell leukemia).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Death\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton  died on Sunday, April 5, 1992 (three months shy of Walmart's thirtieth anniversary), of [myeloma](multiple)(multiple myeloma), a type of blood cancer, in [Rock, Arkansas](Little)(Little Rock, Arkansas). The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Walmart stores. At the time, his company employed 400,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50&nbsp;billion flowed from 1,735 Walmarts, 212 Sam's Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: [Walton](Rob)(S. Robson Walton) succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and [Walton](John)(John T. Walton) was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son [Walton](Jim)(Jim Walton) is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother [Walton](Bud)(Bud Walton)&mdash;[Kroenke](Ann)(Ann Walton Kroenke) and [Laurie](Nancy)(Nancy Walton Laurie)&mdash;hold smaller shares in the company.\n",

      "Completion: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Samuel Moore Walton (1918–1992) was an American businessman best known for founding Walmart and Sam’s Club, retail giants that revolutionized the discount store industry. Born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, Walton grew up during the Great Depression and developed a strong work ethic early on by helping his family with various chores and jobs. After graduating from the University of Missouri with a degree in economics and serving as a captain in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps during World War II, Walton embarked on a career in retail. He initially managed and expanded a chain of Ben Franklin variety stores before opening the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. Walton's innovative approach, including offering low prices by leveraging logistics, bulk purchasing, and locating stores in smaller towns with less competition, helped Walmart grow rapidly into the world's largest retailer.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Walton introduced several pioneering business strategies, such as sharing equity stakes with managers to motivate them and consistently improving operations through hands-on visits to stores across the country. The Walmart business model focused heavily on efficiency, logistics, and customer accessibility, which allowed it to outcompete traditional retailers. By 1985, Walmart had expanded to 800 stores, setting the stage for its dominance in the retail sector. Walton also emphasized American-made products and sought to foster a corporate culture of service leadership, rooted in his Christian values. Alongside his brother Bud, Walton played a key role in driving Walmart’s expansion and success, which had a significant economic and social impact known as the “Walmart Effect.”\\n\\nWalton married Helen Robson in 1943 and had four children, many of whom inherited and remain involved with the company. Known for his philanthropy and active involvement in his church, Walton remained dedicated to serving both the community and his employees. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and died in 1992, shortly before Walmart celebrated its 30th anniversary. Posthumously, Walton has been recognized as one of the most influential business figures of the 20th century, receiving honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His legacy endures through Walmart’s continued global presence and the Walton family’s ongoing wealth and philanthropic endeavors.\"}]\n"

      "\n",
      "was an American [magnate](business)(business magnate) best known for founding the retailers [Walmart](Walmart) and [Club](Sam's)(Sam's Club), which he started in 1962 and 1983 respectively. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the [States](United)(United States). [family](His)(Walton family) has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in [Oklahoma](Kingfisher,)(Kingfisher, Oklahoma). He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for [Life](Metropolitan)(Metropolitan Life) Insurance, where he [foreclosed](foreclosure) on farms during the [Depression](Great)(Great Depression).\n",
      "\n",
      "He and his family (now with another son, [James](James \"Bud\" Walton), born in 1921) moved from [Oklahoma](Oklahoma). They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in [Missouri](Shelbina,)(Shelbina, Missouri), Sam became the youngest [Scout](Eagle)(Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)) in the state's history. In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the [Eagle Scout Award](Distinguished)(Distinguished Eagle Scout Award) from the [Scouts of America](Boy)(Boy Scouts of America).\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually the family moved to [Missouri](Columbia,)(Columbia, Missouri). Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver *[Daily Tribune](Columbia)(Columbia Daily Tribune)* newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions. Upon graduating from [H. Hickman High School](David)(David H. Hickman High School) in Columbia, he was voted \"Most Versatile Boy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "[[in his high school yearbook, 1936](File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|Walton)]\n",
      "\n",
      "After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the [of Missouri](University)(University of Missouri) as an [ROTC](ROTC) cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the [Phi](Zeta)(Zeta Phi) chapter of [Theta Pi](Beta)(Beta Theta Pi) fraternity. He was also tapped by [QEBH](QEBH), the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society [and Blade](Scabbard)(Scabbard and Blade). Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and [College](Stephens)(Stephens College). Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted \"permanent president\" of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton joined [C. Penney](J.)(J. C. Penney) as a management trainee in [Moines, Iowa](Des)(Des Moines, Iowa), three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in [War II](World)(World War II). In the meantime, he worked at a [DuPont](DuPont) munitions plant near [Oklahoma](Tulsa,)(Tulsa, Oklahoma). Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the [Army Intelligence Corps](U.S.)(Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)), supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at [Douglas](Fort)(Fort Douglas, Utah) in [Lake City](Salt)(Salt Lake City), [Utah](Utah). He eventually reached the rank of [captain](Captain (United States O-3)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## The first stores\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a [Franklin](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)) variety store in [Arkansas](Newport,)(Newport, Arkansas). The store was a franchise of the [Brothers](Butler)(Butler Brothers) chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny \"Eagle\" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called \"a fair price\".Walton & Huey, *Made in America: My Story*, p. 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Five and Dime store, Bentonville, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|left|Walton's Five and Dime, now the Walmart Historical Museum, Bentonville.](File:Walton's)]\n",
      "\n",
      "With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of [Arkansas](Bentonville,)(Bentonville, Arkansas). Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease.

      "Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.\n",

      "With the new Bentonville \"Five and Dime\" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the [baby boom](postwar)(Post–World War II baby boom) in full effect), Walton became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more [Franklin franchises](Ben)(Ben Franklin (company)). (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother [\"Bud\" Walton](James)(James \"Bud\" Walton) having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son [John](John T. Walton) would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1954, he opened a store with his brother [Bud](James \"Bud\" Walton) in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of [City, Missouri](Kansas)(Kansas City, Missouri). With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklin's and one independent, in Fayetteville).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## First Walmart\n",
      "\n",
      "The first true [Walmart](Walmart) opened on July 2, 1962, in [Arkansas](Rogers,)(Rogers, Arkansas). Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the [Meijer](Meijer) store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer's original innovative concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton's model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make his model work, he emphasized [logistics](logistics), particularly locating stores within a day's drive of Walmart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growthfrom 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800was achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given its scale and economic influence, Walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store. These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the \"Walmart Effect\".\n",
      "\n",
      "## Personal life\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton married [Robson](Helen)(Helen Walton) on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: [Robson (Rob)](Samuel)(Samuel Robson Walton) born in 1944, [Thomas](John)(John Thomas Walton) (1946–2005), [Carr (Jim)](James)(James Carr Walton) born in 1948, and [Louise](Alice)(Alice Louise Walton) born in 1949.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students. The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of “service leadership” into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of [Christ](Jesus) being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in [Christianity](Christianity).\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton was diagnosed and treated for [cell leukemia](Hairy)(Hairy cell leukemia).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Death\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton  died on Sunday, April 5, 1992 (three months shy of Walmart's thirtieth anniversary), of [myeloma](multiple)(multiple myeloma), a type of blood cancer, in [Rock, Arkansas](Little)(Little Rock, Arkansas). The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Walmart stores. At the time, his company employed 400,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50&nbsp;billion flowed from 1,735 Walmarts, 212 Sam's Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: [Walton](Rob)(S. Robson Walton) succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and [Walton](John)(John T. Walton) was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son [Walton](Jim)(Jim Walton) is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother [Walton](Bud)(Bud Walton)&mdash;[Kroenke](Ann)(Ann Walton Kroenke) and [Laurie](Nancy)(Nancy Walton Laurie)&mdash;hold smaller shares in the company.\n",

      "Completion: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Samuel Moore Walton was an influential American business magnate born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, in 1918. After growing up during the Great Depression and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Walton entered the retail industry, starting his career with management roles at J.C. Penney and gaining experience in logistics and merchandising. In 1945, with a modest loan and savings, he purchased his first Ben Franklin variety store in Arkansas, which laid the foundation for his innovative approach to retailing, emphasizing competitive pricing, wide product selection, and efficient logistics.\\n\\nWalton's vision culminated in the opening of the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. He built his business by locating stores in smaller towns, leveraging volume purchasing, and establishing a strong distribution network through in-house trucking. Walton's emphasis on American-made goods and customer service, along with his focus on cost control and logistics, enabled Walmart to grow rapidly from a single store to a retail giant. By the 1980s, Walmart had expanded to hundreds of stores across multiple states, becoming the world's largest retailer and a major economic force.\\n\\nThroughout his life, Walton was also known for his philanthropy and strong Christian faith, supporting various charitable causes and promoting values of service leadership within his company. Walton passed away in 1992 from multiple myeloma, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential figures in retail history. His family continued to maintain his business empire, with the Walton heirs remaining among the wealthiest in the United States, and his impact visible in the widespread presence of Walmart stores both domestically and internationally.\"}]\n"
